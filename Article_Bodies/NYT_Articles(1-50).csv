0,"Correction AppendedA large poster outside the Washington office of Fannie Mae's new chief executive lists the promises all senior managers were recently instructed to make to reshape the company's culture.Among the mortgage giant's new house rules: Demonstrate humility. Communicate openly. Make the company a no-spin zone. Respect the views of others. Minimize internal politics. Apologize and quickly fix mistakes.The principles stand in stark contrast to how Fannie Mae long operated. Under Franklin D. Raines and his predecessors, the company was criticized by investors and lawmakers for making arrogance an art form. It relied on an army of professional lobbyists and powerful strategic alliances in the housing and finance industries to silence critics. And when federal investigators found almost $11 billion worth of accounting errors in 2004, Fannie denied it had any problems, choosing to attack its regulator instead.Now, Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie's chief executive, is trying to change the company's old ways. But even he acknowledges that it will take far more than a new mission statement to prepare the company for the political and business challenges ahead. First up is a highly critical report by investigators led by former Senator Warren B. Rudman, which is expected to be released as early as next week.Mr. Mudd said that he did not expect the report to be ""a flattering piece of prose.""""We have a long way to go,"" he said in an interview this week at the company's headquarters. ""Of all the things, the one with the longest tail is the culture.""But taking a hard look at itself is crucial to repairing a company that lies at the heart of the American housing market, Mr. Mudd maintained. ""I'd be spinning you if I said it hasn't been disruptive, but it needs to be part of the process, to dig things up, and to deal with them,"" he said. ""It's painful, but it has been healthy.""On top of the Rudman report, a flurry of federal regulators -- including the Justice Department, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight -- are continuing to look under Fannie's hood.They are examining how executives violated accounting rules to smooth its earnings, leading Fannie Mae's board to force out Mr. Raines and most of his senior management team beginning in December 2004.About 2,000 outside accountants and consultants have swarmed through its offices, taking over parts of the cafeteria and Mr. Raines's former wood-paneled office, to help clean up the accounting mess.On Wall Street, where the company's share price and dividend have been almost halved, investors are hearing from Fannie more often but can glean few details. Until the company completes its accounting restatement -- a job that analysts suggest will take at least another year -- it is limited in what it can say.At the same time, Fannie is not quite the mortgage behemoth it once was. Today, the market is flooded with more nontraditional mortgages, like interest-only and ARM loans, that the company largely eschewed. And Fannie is now facing intense competition from companies like Countrywide Financial, Lehman Brothers and Wells Fargo, which have become huge packagers of mortgages in the secondary market.More ominously, legislation that threatens the very core of its business looms in Congress. Among the options the Senate is considering are creating a new, stronger regulator and imposing sharp limits on the size of its highly profitable portfolio.For all the discussion of a humbler, gentler Fannie Mae, critics say little has changed. ""All the talk of the new Fannie Mae -- we are warm and fuzzy now, everybody loves us -- means nothing unless you put the proper oversight structure in place,"" said Mike House, executive director of FM Policy Focus, a lobbyist group backed by the company's mortgage industry rivals. Besides, he added, ""the only reason that Fannie changed their way of doing business is because they were caught.""Created by Congress during the Great Depression, Fannie Mae and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, have become twin titans of the American housing market. Instead of lending directly to consumers, they buy bundles of mortgages and then either resell them as securities or hold them in their portfolios.Supporters argue that this greater liquidity has helped lower housing costs and keep interest rates low, and the perceived stability has allowed homebuyers to lock in rates for as long as 30 years.But critics say that Fannie Mae's status as a quasi-public enterprise has simply subsidized rich investors instead of homebuyers and led to a heavy-handed approach in dealing with critics and regulators.This week, Ben S. Bernanke, in his first appearance before Congress as the new chairman of the Federal Reserve, called for requirements that would cause Fannie to shrink its mortgage portfolio, saying the holdings were ""much larger than can be justified"" by its affordable housing mission, and represented a financial stability risk. Richard C. Shelby, the Alabama Republican who heads the Senate banking committee, has advanced legislation that he expects to bring to the floor this year to impose a tougher regulatory regime and curtail the company's portfolio.Last October, the House adopted a measure over the objections of the Bush administration that imposed few new limits and was largely to the liking of the company.The legislation sponsored by Mr. Shelby goes further, but in the process has alienated many Democrats, who say that reining in Fannie could result in higher housing costs for those in lower income levels.Mr. Mudd said he did not see legislation as a necessity to put the scandal to rest, a comment that Mr. Shelby said was ""self-serving"" as well as incorrect.Since becoming Fannie's chief executive a little more than a year ago, Mr. Mudd, 47, has been on a mission to reshape the company's culture and distance himself from its previous management team. (He was the chief operating officer under Mr. Raines but was not involved in the accounting scandal.)The new tone of outreach and humility acknowledges that Fannie's old insular and arrogant stance was not working. Yet, it also reflects the leadership style of Mr. Mudd, a confident but approachable former Marine captain who is a son of Roger Mudd, the former TV newsman.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Mudd has tried hard to repair relationships with Fannie Mae's main regulators, lawmakers and critics. When Mr. Raines testified in front of Congress in October 2004, he denied that the company's accounting was improper. When Mr. Mudd returned in his place a few months later, he opened his remarks with an apology.He has made contrition a central theme. Last fall, he invited Richard H. Baker, a longtime critic who chairs the House subcommittee that oversees Fannie Mae, to address the company's advisory council. In a speech before the National Association of Home Builders last month, Mr. Mudd referenced the old parable: pride goes before the fall.""It was very frustrating to deal with Fannie Mae in the past -- you weren't asked for your opinions but were told what to do,"" said Jerry Howard, the head of the homebuilders' industry group. ""They are now a partner where you can conduct conversation and dialogue.""Mr. Mudd has also ratcheted down Fannie's well-oiled lobbying machine. The company cut its external lobbying 24 percent in 2005, to $3.7 million, by letting go about six out of several dozen lobbying firms and eliminating advocacy spots on television. Mr. Mudd said he had also refocused the mission of its 52 community offices on business issues rather than ribbon-cutting ceremonies.But tactically, Fannie seems to have simply lowered the volume of its approach instead of scaling it back. In public filings yesterday, the company reported its overall lobbying budget actually rose about 15 percent, to $10.1 million, which it attributed to an increase in administrative costs and internal lobbying efforts. And when the House bill was being considered last fall, Fannie still pressed hard.""They had their own people,"" Mr. House of FM Policy Focus said. ""Plus, they had the homebuilders and Realtors lobby for them.""With three groups of federal investigators routinely banging on its doors, Fannie may have little choice but to keep a lower profile.At the same time, profits from its core business of buying and holding mortgages are under pressure. Until the accounting problems surfaced, Fannie snapped up bundles of mortgages, expanding its portfolio to $905 billion in 2004.Shortly after its chief regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, required Fannie to increase substantially its capital reserves because of the accounting troubles, the company began selling off parts of its portfolio. It shrank by about 20 percent by the end of 2005. Only in the last few months has Fannie again become a buyer.Although Mr. Mudd expects to continue increasing the portfolio, Fannie no longer wields the buying clout it had just a few years ago. Whereas Fannie once packaged about 40 percent of all new mortgage loans, its share fell to less than 20 percent in 2005, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, an industry newsletter.""The markets are getting more competitive and the protection afforded by their implicit subsidy is getting eroded,"" said Dwight M. Jaffee, a professor of real estate finance at the University of California, Berkeley. And hedging against home price inflation and interest rate risk could eat into profits even more.The accounting issues, meanwhile, have done little to help. ""Fannie is so involved in the massive accounting restatement that they don't have time to focus on new products, marketing to new customers, or just building the businesses,"" added Guy Cecala, the publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance.Mr. Mudd plans to change that, too. Even as its critics try to limit Fannie's activities, the company is trying to grow its nascent business of financing apartment projects. He also has plans to enter the construction lending business and subprime mortgage market, among others to be announced this summer.But with release of the Rudman report next week, there may be another crisis to manage. When asked if he had spoken to Mr. Raines, Mr. Mudd took an uncharacteristically long pause to choose his words.""I have,"" Mr. Mudd said. ""I obviously would have liked to have gotten the job under a different set of circumstances.""""I hope things work out positively for Frank,"" he added.Correction: February 23, 2006, Thursday Labels on a chart in Business Day on Saturday showing market share in secondary mortgages were reversed. Fannie Mae had a 24 percent share last year; Freddie Mac had 20 percent."
1,"WHEN a traffic signal at a busy intersection flashes green and red at the same time, it can be a white-knuckle moment -- unless you stop, look carefully, and make your own considered judgment whether it's safe to proceed.Signals from the economy have been a bit like that lately. The bond market has been predicting a recession while the stock market has been signaling strong growth ahead. And economists are divided. Some are forecasting a nasty downturn in 2007 while others expect the expansion to remain firmly on track. Given these mixed signals, it's wise to spend a little extra effort to figure out what's actually happening. You may find the exercise encouraging.First, a bit of history as a guide. This month marks the current economic expansion's fifth birthday, an advanced age that might suggest that a slowdown is coming soon. In the past 25 years or so, though, major structural changes in the economy -- including a shift in emphasis from manufacturing to services, and growing use of information technology to manage inventories and operations -- have lengthened the business cycle.The more proactive approach of the Federal Reserve has also helped. The last two economic cycles lasted 10 years each, much longer than many previous ones. If recent history is a guide, we are in the middle of the current business cycle, with years of prosperity ahead.That would be consistent with the conflicting signs in the data and the markets. About midway through a typical business cycle, there is often a shift in the sources of growth -- away from interest-rate-sensitive sectors like housing and autos, and toward others like business investment. But any transition is tricky, and the changeover is not always smooth.A bumpy economic transition seems under way now. Growth has slowed to an annual rate of 1.6 percent in the third quarter from 5.6 percent in the first quarter, as activity in housing and autos has cooled, while business investment hasn't surged. Still, there are good reasons to be optimistic about where this transition will take us.For starters, a lot is going right in the economy. The corporate sector is enjoying record levels of cash and strong profits, and the stock market has been climbing. The global economy is humming along, and the outlook for Europe and Asia is upbeat. Crude oil has come down sharply, to less than $60 a barrel from more than $70. And the latest inflation figures are benign. The Producer Price Index fell 1.6 percent in October, with core prices excluding food and energy dropping 0.9 percent; the Consumer Price Index also declined, by 0.5 percent.That isn't all. The capacity utilization rate -- an indicator of production levels in factories and mines -- has begun to drift downward from peak levels, in line with moderate growth and easing inflationary pressures. At the same time, employment is robust, with the jobless rate at 4.4 percent last month. And the Federal Reserve has stopped raising rates, at least for now.Still, the economy faces risks. In the bond market, the yield curve is inverted, a classic sign of trouble. An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term market interest rates are higher than long-term rates, often indicating that investors expect a recession. One possible reason for pessimism is the downturn in the housing market, which could hurt consumer spending. That, in turn, could cause corporate America to cut back its spending and expansion plans, sending the economy into recession -- or so it is feared. (Consumer spending, though, has held up well so far, probably because of falling gas prices and the strong labor market.)The housing slump's effect on construction has been significant. According to government figures, construction of new single-family homes and apartments dropped to an annual rate of 1.486 million units last month; that is down 14.6 percent from September, and is the lowest level in more than six years. Home builders like Beazer Homes and Toll Brothers have said they still don't see any bottom in the market.But even if the housing slowdown hurts consumer spending in the coming months, economists like Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com doubt that it will derail the expansion. ""The only way the housing correction can undermine the economy is if it first infects financial markets,"" Mr. Zandi said. ""For that to occur we'd need a financial event which hurts global investor confidence or the banking sector directly, and becomes a global problem.""It is possible to imagine such a situation. ""Many people including myself believe that the market is underpricing risk,"" said Martin N. Baily, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute, a research organization based in Washington. ""It looks like some institutions may be taking on more risk than they realize, and if there are defaults or asset price declines then they may get into trouble and it might spread.""In particular, some economists have been concerned that as the housing market softens, lenders have issued mortgages to people who can't afford to pay them back. If that results in a large number of defaults and losses, the fast-growing market in subprime mortgage-backed securities could be undermined.""Credit risk is increasingly being borne by securities holders, in particular those holding collateralized debt obligations,"" said Jonathan Reiss, the principal of Analytical Synthesis, a research group based in New York. ""The result is that the originators of the loan are much less exposed to the consequences than they were even, say, five years ago, and there's a feeling that somehow this could all end badly.""BUT Mr. Reiss and others, while appreciating the risk of a financial market crisis, are not predicting one. What's more, it's hard to figure the economic consequences of a financial crisis. The last major one, which began with the Asian crisis in 1997 and culminated in the near-collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, didn't derail the economic expansion of the '90s. And even the combination of a bursting stock bubble and Sept. 11, 2001, caused only a brief setback for the overall economy.So, at the moment, cautious optimism seems the most sensible approach. Mixed signals from the markets and divided opinions from the experts may be unsettling, but they are consistent with the prospect of a long stretch of prosperity ahead. Perhaps we shouldn't really worry until all the signs begin to point the same way."
2,"CHICAGO - In the housing boom of the last six years, millions of blacks, Hispanics and members of other minority groups achieved the dream of homeownership. While a steadily growing economy helped, experts say a new breed of high-cost home loans deserved much of the credit.Now, however, those gains are being threatened by those very same mortgages, many of them resetting to even higher interest rates.Delinquencies and foreclosures, though still low by historical standards, are rising fastest among these borrowers, a group that is commonly referred to as subprime because they have troubled credit records or otherwise have difficulty obtaining a mortgage. There were almost six millions such loans outstanding at the end of June.The problems tend to be concentrated in areas facing other forms of economic stress as well. But while the rise in delinquencies is not expected to have much of a reverberating impact on the overall housing market and the national economy, experts say that the pain will be all too real for borrowers and many of the neighborhoods they live in.Housing advocates, regulators and lenders who have anticipated the problem are trying to pre-empt it by reaching out to borrowers before they fall too far behind on monthly payments. They are moving to help them refinance, sell their property or restructure their debts.Shirley H. Byrd is just the kind of person in need of help. Ms. Byrd, a janitor at a Chicago Police Department precinct, has been struggling to catch up with delinquent payments on her brick home on the South Side of the city near Midway Airport. Her adjustable rate loan, which she took out in late 1998 at a 10 percent interest rate -- to refinance a previous loan -- has risen to more than 12 percent.In November, a housing counselor persuaded Morgan Stanley, which now owns the loan originally made by ABN Amro, to convert her loan to an 8 percent fixed-rate mortgage. Ms. Byrd, 52, said the lower rate, along with a second job at the Postal Service, should help her stabilize her finances, which had fallen into disarray because she has been supporting other family members out of work or suffering from chronic health conditions.""I guess somebody up there heard me, because I have been praying,"" said Ms. Byrd, who filed for bankruptcy protection in late 2004.Housing experts say Ms. Byrd is fortunate that she sought help early enough so that counselors working through the National Training and Information Center, an advocacy group in Chicago, could negotiate on her behalf. Many in her situation do not fare as well, officials say, because they do not seek help or do so too late. In other instances, lenders or investors who own the loans may not agree to changes.Ms. Byrd and other homeowners in her situation make up a relatively small portion of the national housing market. And while lenders are starting to become more cautious, unless the troubles escalate substantially, most of the mortgage industry is not expected to be seriously scarred.""What has been missing in people's views is that these mortgages, these risky mortgages are not universally dispersed across the United States,"" said Susan M. Wachter, a professor of real estate finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. ""These populations are spatially concentrated.""So far, a healthy national job market has kept the distress limited to the Great Lakes region, where manufacturing industries have sharply cut employment, and the Gulf Coast, where rebuilding efforts after the hurricanes are proceeding slowly.But economists worry that if the economy slows significantly in 2007, the number of poor and financially struggling households facing the potential loss of their homes could escalate sharply, adding to the troubles of the subprime industry.Big concentrations of subprime loans exist along the Texas border with Mexico, in California and in Southern cities with large minority populations. Within metropolitan areas, urban and minority neighborhoods tend to have more of these loans then suburban and primarily white areas.For instance, in Cook County, home to Chicago and nearby suburbs, nearly half of all first-lien home purchase loans made in 2005 were subprime in neighborhoods where minority groups make up 50 percent or more of the population, according to mortgage data collected by the federal government. By comparison, only 30 percent of all loans made countywide over the same period were subprime.These lending patterns have prompted criticism of the mortgage industry by housing advocates who say minorities are often unfairly given higher-cost loans. They point to some companies, like Ameriquest Mortgage, that have settled charges of fraudulent lending, agreeing to pay millions in fines and restitution, though without admitting any wrongdoing.The industry has vigorously defended itself, noting that the expansion of the market has opened up previously closed opportunities. They contend that lenders do not discriminate by race or ethnic group and that interest rates are determined by a wide variety of individual factors, including income, credit scores and the size of down payments.Subprime loans, which tend to run roughly three percentage points or more above the rates available to the most creditworthy borrowers, have become the fastest-growing segment of the mortgage industry.As recently as 2000, there were just 719,000 such loans outstanding, about 2.4 percent of all mortgages, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association of America. By the end of June, though, subprime loans had reached 5.7 million, or 13.4 percent of the total. More than half are adjustable-rate mortgages, compared with just 18 percent for prime loans.Mortgage companies, banks and investors have been aggressively marketing and trading the loans because their higher interest rates make them far more profitable than prime loans, even after taking into account greater default rates. Furthermore, until 2006 the percentage of subprime loans that went bad was falling.In 2005, just 5.9 percent were in foreclosure or in arrears for three months or more, a condition known as serious delinquency. That was down from 8.5 percent in 2000. As of June, the rate had risen to 6.2 percent.In sheer numbers, roughly 350,000 subprime loans were seriously delinquent at the end of June, over six times the number at the end of 2000.Industry officials say the number of subprime borrowers losing their home and encountering distress is growing and sure to increase because there have been so many more mortgages issued in recent years. But they argue that on balance, subprime lending has been beneficial because it has given people who previously did not have access to credit the ability to buy homes. It is a hotly debated contention even within the industry.""We all should be proud as an industry,"" Michael W. Perry, chairman and chief executive of IndyMac Bank, a lender in Pasadena, Calif., told his peers at the Mortgage Bankers Association's annual convention in Chicago recently. ""We have created an enormous amount of wealth for Americans.""Seated next to him on the stage, Daniel H. Mudd, the chief executive of Fannie Mae, acknowledged that the industry had helped expand homeownership, but suggested that it may have gotten carried away during the recent boom.""Ultimately, putting people in a home they cannot stay in is not a business we should be in,"" he said.This autumn, federal banking regulators issued new rules to tighten lending standards, aiming chiefly at adjustable-rate mortgages. The regulations require lenders to determine if loans with low introductory interest rates and terms that allow borrowers to make minimum monthly payment are suitable for their intended borrowers. Lenders can no longer make loans to applicants who do not earn enough to make payments at the highest interest rates possible under the loan's terms.Though well intentioned and long overdue, some experts say, the rules could add to the pain for subprime borrowers, who may no longer qualify for mortgages under the new, tougher standards just when many will need a new loan to get out of a financial bind.""That could make it very difficult for these distressed borrowers to refinance,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com.Mr. Zandi expects the homeownership rate to fall from its recent peak but remain higher than it was before the boom. Nationally, 69 percent of all households owned their own home in the third quarter of 2006, up from 66.8 percent in 1999, according to the Census Bureau; for minorities the rate increased to 51.7 percent, from 47.4 percent.The risk of losing a home is greatest for borrowers who face several hardships, housing experts say, not just a variable-rate loan. Rising interest rates will not by themselves force homeowners to default, but they will increase the risks for borrowers living on a fixed income, who do not have enough equity to refinance, obtain a second mortgage or who happen to be living in areas where home values are falling.David Rose, director of research and training at the National Training and Information Center in Chicago, said he had been struck by the growth in adjustable-rate lending to the elderly and low-income borrowers who are least able to adjust to higher payments. ""That's where the product makes the least amount of sense,"" he said.It was not always so. Before the meteoric rise of subprime lending, first-time borrowers with spotty credit often turned to loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration and issued by banks. Created during the Depression to stimulate the housing market, the F.H.A. insured slightly fewer than 5 percent of all home purchase loans issued in 2005, down from 19 percent in 2000.Even though they typically charge higher interest rates, private lenders have made the F.H.A. less relevant by providing credit on easier terms, experts say. The F.H.A., for example, requires borrowers to make a down payment of at least 3 percent of the purchase price, but many subprime lenders ask for none.Moreover, the F.H.A. cannot insure loans larger than $362,790, which limits its scope in California and other high-price areas, while many subprime lenders impose no limits.The House has approved a proposal by the F.H.A. to eliminate the minimum down payment and raise the loan limits. The measure has bipartisan support, but it is not expected to pass until 2007.""We want to be able to reach deeper into the borrowers' pool and help those who are not being well served by the mortgage market,"" said Brian D. Montgomery, an assistant secretary at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which oversees the F.H.A.That will do little, however, to help many subprime borrowers, who will face their first significant test in the coming year. And while the vast majority of homeowners are financially secure enough to cope with the downturn in the housing market, higher rates and a slowing economy would pose a much tougher challenge for subprime borrowers.""It's going to have a material impact,"" said Richard D. Powers, general manager of Ditech.com, the Internet-based lender that does about 13 percent of its business in subprime mortgages. ""There will be clusters and pools of borrowers that will be disproportionately affected."""
3,"About one in five subprime mortgages made in the last two years are likely to go into foreclosure, according to a report released yesterday, ending the dream of homeownership for millions of Americans.At that rate, about 1.1 million homeowners who took out subprime loans in the last two years will lose their houses in the next few years, the report said. The foreclosures will cost those homeowners an estimated $74.6 billion, primarily in equity.The report, written by the Center for Responsible Lending, a research group in Durham, N.C., was based on data supplied by Moody's Economy.com. Researchers examined more than six million mortgages made from 1998 until the third quarter of 2006; the report is the first nationwide study on the performance of subprime mortgages. It includes projected foreclosure data for all major metropolitan statistical areas. The highest default rates are expected to be in cities in California, Nevada, Michigan and New Jersey as well as Washington, D.C.The report offers a somber assessment of loans that had helped millions of Americans with blemished credit attain homeownership. About 2.2 million borrowers who took subprime loans from 1998 to 2006 are likely to lose their homes.Subprime loans are made to borrowers with unfavorable credit.Mortgage companies, banks and investors began aggressively marketing and trading the loans in the early part of the decade because their higher interest rates make them more profitable.As a result, subprime loans now make up more than a quarter of the mortgage market, more than $600 billion in 2005. ""This is no longer a niche part of the market that can be dismissed,"" said Keith Ernst, senior housing counsel at the research center and one of the authors of the report. ""It's a major component of the mortgage market and the growing rates of foreclosures should be a cause for alarm.""The report cited several factors for the increase in subprime mortgage foreclosures -- including adjustable rate mortgages with steep built-in rate and payment increases, prepayment penalties, limited income documentation and no escrow for taxes and insurance. The report said the features caused a higher risk of default regardless of the borrower's credit score.""This means that people are not going into foreclosure just because they have low incomes,"" Mr. Ernst said. ""The foreclosures are higher than they need to be because a number of loan features in the subprime market place borrowers at unnecessary risk.""Minority homeowners take out a disproportionate share of subprime loans. The most recent Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data from lending institutions show that over half of African-Americans and 40 percent of Hispanics received subprime loans.The report projects that 10 percent of the African-American borrowers and 8 percent of Hispanic borrowers will be affected by foreclosure. In contrast, only 4 percent of recent white borrowers are expected to be affected.The center suggests that risky lending practices could lead to the worst foreclosure crisis in the modern mortgage market.Douglas Duncan, chief economist for the Mortgage Bankers Association, called the center's study overly pessimistic.""Every forecast models makes assumptions, but it seems they picked the worst case scenario,"" Mr. Duncan said.Mr. Duncan said the banker's association's numbers did show an increase in foreclosures but that was because there were more borrowers.The center's report comes as more attention is paid to subprime lending. State regulators have cracked down on what they see as predatory practices by many lenders.Federal regulators have issued new guidelines that will tighten lending standards, aiming chiefly at adjustable-rate mortgages. And the federal government, through the Federal Housing Administration, has attempted to reform its lending programs to better compete in the mortgage market.The House has approved a proposal by the F.H.A. to eliminate the minimum down payment and raise the loan limits, allowing it to offer loans that would enable borrowers to avoid the risk of subprime mortgages.Wade Henderson, president and chief executive of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights in Washington, praised the proposed changes but said other efforts were needed.""We need rules to curb predatory lenders, but we also need prime lenders to step up for this expanding market of borrowers,"" Henderson said. ""The lending community needs to step forward and take responsibility. It should not let itself be defined by its worst actors."""

5,"NEW YORK —The toll is mounting for lenders that operate in the riskiest, and until recently, the fastest-growing, segment of the U.S. mortgage business.Shares of NovaStar Financial, which makes loans to people with weak credit, fell almost 43 percent on Wednesday after the company announced a surprise loss of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter and told investors that it might not make enough money to pay dividends for the next four years.The announcement, which highlighted the fact that more home loans made last year were delinquent than mortgages from 2005 and earlier, echoed reports issued earlier this month by New Century Financial and HSBC Finance, the American mortgage division of the global banking giant.Though each lender is suffering from a variety of individual ills, rising default rates among loans made to people with spotty, or subprime, credit appear to be the central problem for the industry.A major indicator of the trouble in the subprime market is the early-payment default rate, which measures the portion of borrowers who fall behind on their house payments within the first few months of taking a loan.Rising default rates and the related financial troubles of mortgage companies could hurt a broad segment of the American housing market.Among them will be the largely poor and minority home buyers who will see interest rates on adjustable mortgages rise, as well as investors in mortgage- backed securities who poured billions of dollars into these loans.The default rate jumped for loans made in 2006, as lenders allowed more borrowers to take out loans without documenting their incomes or making a down payment. Also, analysts note, homeowners who encountered financial problems had a tougher time refinancing or selling their properties because home prices were no longer rising in many parts of the country.""When there is good home price appreciation, you can get away with a lot of mistakes,"" said Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensics accounting firm in Washington that has been studying the subprime market. ""But home price appreciation has stopped.""Subprime lenders were particularly susceptible to the change in the housing market, because they dealt with borrowers who often stretched financially to buy homes; more than half, for instance, took out adjustable mortgages. Many subprime lenders were not obligated to follow the tougher regulations that apply to commercial banks.In a conference call after the market close on Tuesday, executives at NovaStar attributed the company's problems to a swiftly deteriorating housing market. The company, which is based in Kansas City, Missouri, promised to tighten its guidelines and limit the number of exceptions to those rules.The company also said it would most likely not earn any taxable income for the next four years, though it did expect to have a positive net income. That is significant, because to maintain a favorable tax status as a real estate investment trust, NovaStar has to distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.Still, executives tried to focus on the positive and said NovaStar had enough cash on hand to weather its current problems. They also noted that as more mortgage companies encountered problems, NovaStar could face less competition.""The question that management is looking at right now is, is it in shareholders' best interest to remain a REIT?"" asked Scott Hartman, the company's chief executive.Some of its investors were a bit less sanguine than that.The company's biggest shareholder, Dreman Value Management of Jersey City, New Jersey, has been trying to liquidate its 5.8 percent stake in NovaStar, portfolio managers at the investment company said Wednesday.Some analysts and investors say the problems at NovaStar and other subprime lenders have been evident for some weeks and months.In late January, NovaStar posted the performance of the mortgages it securitized and sold to investors on its Web site. Investors who had been paying attention would have noted that the delinquency rate for loans made in 2006 had jumped to 7 percent from 2 percent in 2005, Gast of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis said.NovaStar has also been a favorite among short sellers, investors who make money by betting that a price of a stock will fall. Short interest in the company's shares made up about a third of its total shares outstanding last month.""When we initially shorted the stock, it was obvious that there was going to be some distress here,"" said Whitney Tilson, who heads the hedge fund firm T2 Partners and who took a small short position in the stock in the last couple of weeks. ""But when a company announces that they're not going to have taxable income for four years, that's amazing."""
6,"The toll is mounting for lenders that operate in the riskiest, and until recently, the fastest-growing, segment of the mortgage business.Shares of NovaStar Financial, which makes loans to people with weak credit, fell almost 43 percent yesterday after the company announced a surprise loss of $14.4 million for the fourth quarter and told investors that it might not make enough money to pay dividends for the next four years.The announcement, which highlighted the fact that more home loans made last year were delinquent than mortgages from 2005 and earlier, echoed reports issued earlier this month by New Century Financial and HSBC Finance, the American mortgage division of the global banking giant.Though each lender is suffering from a variety of individual ills, rising default rates among loans made to people with spotty, or subprime, credit appear to be the central problem for the industry.A major indicator of the trouble in the subprime market is the early-payment default rate, which measures the portion of borrowers who fall behind on their house payments within the first few months of taking a loan.Rising default rates and the related financial troubles of mortgage companies could hurt a broad segment of the American housing market. Among them will be the largely poor and minority home buyers who will see interest rates on adjustable mortgages rise, as well as investors in mortgage-backed securities who poured billions of dollars into these loans.The default rate jumped for loans made in 2006, as lenders allowed more borrowers to take out loans without documenting their incomes or making a down payment. Also, analysts note, homeowners who encountered financial problems had a tougher time refinancing or selling their properties because home prices were no longer rising in many parts of the country.“When there is good home price appreciation, you can get away with a lot of mistakes,” said Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensics accounting firm in Washington that has been studying the subprime market. “But home price appreciation has stopped.”Subprime lenders were particularly susceptible to the change in the housing market, because they dealt with borrowers who often stretched financially to buy homes; more than half, for instance, took out adjustable mortgages. Many subprime lenders were not obligated to follow the tougher regulations that apply to commercial banks.In a conference call after the market close on Tuesday, executives at NovaStar attributed the company’s problems to a swiftly deteriorating housing market. The company, which is based in Kansas City, Mo., promised to tighten its guidelines and limit the number of exceptions to those rules.The company also said it would most likely not earn any taxable income for the next four years, though it did expect to have a positive net income. That is significant, because to maintain a favorable tax status as a real estate investment trust, NovaStar has to distribute at least 90 percent of its taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends.Still, executives tried to focus on the positive and said NovaStar had enough cash on hand to weather its current problems. They also noted that as more mortgage companies encountered problems, NovaStar could face less competition.“The question that management is looking at right now is, is it in shareholders’ best interest to remain a REIT?” asked Scott Hartman, the company’s chief executive.Some of its investors were a bit less sanguine than that.The company’s biggest shareholder, Dreman Value Management of Jersey City, has been trying to liquidate its 5.8 percent stake in NovaStar, portfolio managers at the investment company said yesterday.Mark J. Roach, a portfolio manager at Dreman, said his fund made a good return on shares of NovaStar in 2005 but has been cutting back its exposure since. He said it now made up only 0.3 percent of the small-cap fund he manages, down from 2.5 percent in 2005.David N. Dreman, the chairman and chief investment officer of the fund company, said he has grown increasingly worried about subprime lenders, but was surprised by the extent of NovaStar’s problems. “There was no indication prior to this that they were going to have a problem,” he said.Some analysts and investors say the problems at NovaStar and other subprime lenders have been evident for some weeks and months.In late January, NovaStar posted the performance of the mortgages it securitized and sold to investors on its Web site. Investors who had been paying attention would have noted that the delinquency rate for loans made in 2006 had jumped to 7 percent from 2 percent in 2005, Mr. Gast of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis said.“They securitize nearly all their loans, so their performance shouldn’t have surprised anybody,” Mr. Gast said. He attributes the rise in delinquencies to the stall in home prices in 2006.NovaStar has also been a favorite among short sellers, investors who make money by betting that a price of a stock will fall. Short interest in the company’s shares made up about a third of its total shares outstanding last month.“When we initially shorted the stock, it was obvious that there was going to be some distress here,” said Whitney Tilson, who heads the hedge fund firm T2 Partners and who took a small short position in the stock in the last couple of weeks. “But when a company announces that they’re not going to have taxable income for four years, that’s amazing.”NovaStar Financial was founded in 1996 by Mr. Hartman, the chief executive, and Lance Anderson, the president, who had worked together at a mortgage banking REIT now known as Dynex Capital, in Richmond, Va.NovaStar’s obituary was nearly written in the late 1990s, when the ripple effect from the Russian debt crisis and the bailout of hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management crushed all assets that were viewed as risky from a credit standpoint. Facing margin calls from Wall Street broker-dealers as the value of its collateral fell, NovaStar stopped paying investors dividends in late 1998 and struggled with losses and liquidity for months afterward.Yet as the subprime market heated up during a long housing boom and the company resumed  and then increased  its dividend payouts, NovaStar found itself at the center of a battle between investors who owned its stock and loved its huge dividend payments and hedge funds who sold its stock short.Over the years, the funds challenged everything from NovaStar’s complicated accounting practices to its use of complex derivatives and whether it had the regulatory licenses to operate in various states.In a conference call in early 2005, NovaStar’s management, who thought the call was over and were unaware there were still listeners on the line, praised the head of investor relations for screening callers who might have asked unwelcome questions. One executive overheard on the phone used an obscenity to ridicule a questioner who asked whether the company’s dividend guidance was inflated.Still, the company had a strong following among investors who were drawn to its high dividend yield, which at $5.60 a share in 2006 was among the highest of real estate investment trusts. One passionate supporter of NovaStar who has acknowledged using a fake name, “Bob O’Brien,” went so far as to start a Web site, www.nfi-info.net, to rebut negative reports on the company.Yesterday, in what he described as “probably my last writing here,” the investor had this to say on the site: “I am shell shocked after the conference that took place yesterday, and quite annoyed that I participated in the collective hallucination that led so many into such a disaster.”"
7,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said Tuesday it would no longer buy high-risk home mortgages that it deems to be highly vulnerable to foreclosure, in a surprise move that came amid a deteriorating market for subprime loans affected by slumping home prices and rising interest ratesThe government-sponsored company, which is the second-biggest financer of home loans in the United States, said it will begin using stricter standards for mortgages that it buys -- including limiting the use of loans requiring less documentation of the borrower's status than conventional mortgages.""The steps we are taking today will provide more protection to consumers and enhance the level of underwriting standards in the market,"" Richard Syron, Freddie Mac's chairman and CEO, said in a statement.The changes will take effect Sept. 1, the company said, to avoid disrupting the mortgage market.The company's new standards cover certain types of hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages that comprise about three-quarters of the subprime market. An adjustable-rate mortgage is considered a higher-risk loan because it typically draws borrowers in with an initial low, or ""teaser"" rate, which can rise substantially over time.Home-mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures are surging, especially for people who took out subprime mortgages -- higher-interest loans for those with blemished credit records or low incomes who are considered higher risks -- during the sizzling housing boom that waned in the latter half of 2005.Write-offs of home mortgage loans by banks and thrifts reached a three-year high in the fourth quarter last year, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. And several financial companies that specialize in subprime mortgages have seen their shares plummet in recent weeks and the industry sector has been roiled.Low-documentation, interest-only and other nontraditional mortgages, which are riskier than conventional home loans, have exploded in popularity in recent years and raised concern about defaults if borrowers cannot meet rising mortgage payments.McLean, Va.-based Freddie Mac, like its larger government-sponsored sibling Fannie Mae, was created by Congress to pump money into the mortgage market by buying home loans from banks and other lenders, in order to keep interest rates low and make home ownership affordable for low- and moderate-income people. The two companies bundle the mortgages into securities for sale on Wall Street.Freddie Mac shares fell 22 cents to $64.71 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange."

9,"WHAT investors don’t know about why the home mortgage securities market is in distress could fill volumes. As is often the case, only after fiery markets burn out do we see the risks that buyers ignore and sellers play down.Because so many players in this world have an interest in keeping risks under wraps, a complete understanding of the mortgage market’s ills may take time. Unlike recent corporate disasters that have occurred at hyperspeed — think Enron and WorldCom — the mortgage securities boom seems to be unwinding in slow motion.But trains wrecks are train wrecks, even when they occur at a crawl.Wall Street, of course, prefers a more upbeat approach. And by the end of last week, many there were celebrating the fact that the indexes on mortgage securities, which had been in free fall, had stabilized. Big brokerage firms have also tried to persuade investors that mortgage woes would be limited to subprime loans — those given to people with weak credit histories.But last Thursday, the annual report fromCountrywide Financial, a major lender, told a different story. While it confirmed fears about subprime loans — 19 percent of those in its portfolio were more than 30 days delinquent at the end of last year, up from 15 percent in 2005 — Countrywide also indicated that the percentage of prime borrowers encountering difficulties is rising. Delinquencies in the company’s prime home equity loan portfolio totaled 2.93 percent, almost double last year’s 1.57 percent.And consider the disclosure last Thursday ofAmerican Home Mortgage Investment, a home mortgage originator and investor that specializes in loans to those with middle-tier, not weak, credit histories. As of year-end, the company said, 8.13 percent of its loans held for sale (not investment) were non-accruing. During the same period in 2005, that figure was just 0.43 percent.“The problems are far broader than subprime,” said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham-Fisher in New York and an expert on mortgage securities. Mr. Rosner says he believes that, absent a huge jump in home prices, investors will soon recognize that credit quality problems have also begun to seep into “the upper tranches” of the loan market.Credit risk, of course, shows up over months and years, while market risk plays out in seconds and minutes. As such, it is easy for some to say that a big decline in the mortgage securities index is an overreaction.Perhaps it is. But the fact that loan losses have not yet shown up in mortgage holdings should calm no one. The way Wall Street packages home loans and sells them to investors adds to their complexity and makes them far tougher to value than other securities.Moreover, a lag in reported defaults is almost certainly attributable to the increasingly aggressive practice of loss mitigation among lenders, in which they try to keep stretched borrowers from defaulting. But investors get little to no information about how lenders work with troubled borrowers and whether those efforts actually cure the problem — or simply postpone the inevitable. As a result, investors do not know whether the default figures they are seeing reflect reality.In 2002, the Office of Inspector General in the Department of Housing and Urban Development reviewed the department’s loss-mitigation program and found some disturbing practices. Financial institutions that were surveyed from May 1999 to April 2001 in many cases chose to delay foreclosures even when it was obvious that loan workouts would probably not succeed, the study said. The audit reviewed practices from 1999 to 2001, but the practices remain very much in place today.Mortgage servicers “are approving borrowers for loss mitigation when, based on the servicers’ expertise and past experience with delinquent borrowers, the workout is unlikely to succeed,” the report said. “These actions are delaying the foreclosure process, increasing the cost of foreclosure, and subsidizing borrowers who do not pay their mortgage for extended periods of time.”The report noted several examples of borrowers who received workouts under truly kooky circumstances. One borrower explained that he could not pay his mortgage because of gambling losses; he received a workout and later filed for bankruptcy protection. In another case, a delinquent borrower got a loss-mitigation deal even though he was continuing to make monthly payments on his Mercedes-Benz that exceeded those on his mortgage.Loss-mitigation practices grew out of the significant losses incurred by big lenders in the real estate collapse of the late 1980s. Because lenders were experiencing losses of 30 percent to 60 percent of the outstanding home loans in foreclosures, they started identifying ways to keep borrowers in their homes.Some plans allow a delinquent borrower to add missed payments to the mortgage and pay them over time. Others extend the life of the loan, or allow the suspension of payments temporarily, bringing the mortgage current by using an interest-free loan from the Federal Housing Administration.While it is a splendid idea to do whatever is necessary to try to cure a sick borrower, it is worth remembering that the rollover of nonperforming loans was central to what made the savings and loan mess of the early 1990s so disastrous. And it is well worth asking: are loss-mitigation practices predatory since they give lenders an opportunity to squeeze the last ounce of blood out of a terminally ill patient?Aggressive approaches to loss mitigation, Mr. Rosner said, mean that less than half of mortgages that in prior years would have been foreclosed no longer are. Unfortunately, how many of these workouts actually succeed is a question for which investors and even regulators have no answer.Academic studies suggest that within the first two years of a workout, re-defaults can approach 25 percent. But there are no publicly available data to analyze the success rates of loss mitigation. And this is something investors sorely need.“There is nothing particularly wrong with loss mitigation,” Mr. Rosner said. “What is wrong is a lack of transparency in whether it is effective or predatory. How can we be surprised when volatility rises? The buyer is recognizing that he does not have appropriate information.”No one likes to face ugly realities like financially ailing borrowers who are so strapped that nothing can save them. Not the lenders, not the Wall Street firms that sell the securities, not even the holders. But experienced investors know that a reliance on fantasy will only prolong the pain that is racking the huge and important mortgage market."
10,"Even in affluent Orange County, Calif., the growing wealth of executives and brokers in the booming mortgage industry was hard to miss.For Kal Elsayed, a former executive at New Century Financial, a large lender based in Irvine, driving a red convertible Ferrari to work at a company that provided home loans to people with low incomes and weak credit might have appeared ostentatious, he now acknowledges. But, he says, that was nothing compared with the private jets that executives at other companies had.“You just lost touch with reality after a while because that’s just how people were living,” said Mr. Elsayed, 42, who spent nine years at New Century before leaving to start his own mortgage firm in 2005. “We made so much money you couldn’t believe it. And you didn’t have to do anything. You just had to show up.”Just as the technology boom of the late 1990s turned twenty-something programmers into dot-com billionaires, and leveraged buyouts a decade earlier turned Wall Street bankers into Masters of the Universe, the explosive growth in subprime lending turned mortgage bankers and brokers into multimillionaires seemingly overnight.Now an escalating crisis in the market, which seemed to reach a new crescendo late last week, is threatening a wide band of people. Foremost are the poor and minority homeowners who used easy credit to buy houses that are turning out to be too expensive for them now that mortgage rates are going up, but the pain is also being felt widely throughout the business world.Large companies that bought subprime lenders during the boom, like H&R Block and HSBC, are now scrambling to sell them or scale back their exposure. Many investors are also likely to suffer: Wall Street firms made billions in fees, commissions and trading revenue from packaging and selling subprime mortgages to them as bonds.New Century has emerged as a poster child for the lenders that rode that boom to the top and are now in free fall. The company disclosed on Friday that federal prosecutors and securities regulators were investigating stock sales and accounting errors. The latter could jeopardize billions of dollars in financing for the company, which issued $39.4 billion in subprime loans in the first nine months of last year.Weakening home prices and rising default rates have rocked the subprime business. But for those who cashed out before the market turned, the ride up was particularly sweet. The three founders of New Century, for example, together made more than $40.5 million in profits from selling shares in the company from 2004 to 2006, according to an analysis by Thomson Financial. They collected millions of dollars more in dividends, salaries, bonuses and perks.The company said in a statement yesterday that the founders were “still significant shareholders,” noting that they collectively owned about 7 percent of the company at the end of last year.New Century’s stock price, which seemed to mirror the trajectory of the subprime business, peaked at nearly $66 a share in December of 2004 and traded in the $40s most of last year; on Friday, it was trading at $11 a share after the market closed. In a series of sales from August to November, two of the company’s founders sold shares for an average price of about $40 a share, for a total profit of $21.4 million.It is not known whether the stock sales by the founders are among the sales being examined by federal investigators. Some of them had been part of scheduled stock sales that are often used by executives to diversify their portfolios. But some of the sales occurred on the same day that the executives entered the plans. A New Century spokeswoman, Laura Oberhelman, said that executives declined further comment.The founders’ stock also rose in the social circles of southern California, the epicenter of the boom in subprime. Five of the 10 biggest providers of subprime mortgages last year had their headquarters in the region.Robert K. Cole, 60, a co-founder who retired as chairman and chief executive last year, lives in a 6,100-square-foot oceanfront home in Laguna Beach that is valued at tens of millions of dollars and was once owned by the chief executive of Pimco Advisors, the giant bond trading and management firm. Edward F. Gotschall, 52, another co-founder who is vice chairman of the board, donated $3 million for an expanded trauma center at Mission Hospital that will be named for him and his wife Susan.The executives from New Century are by no means alone in cashing in on the bonanza, and they do not appear to have scored the biggest profits. That title may be claimed by Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest stand-alone mortgage company and one of the largest subprime lenders last year. He reaped more than $270 million in profits from sales of stock and the exercise of stock options from 2004 to the start of this year, according to the Thompson analysis.Of course, most of the 500,000 people who work in the mortgage industry did not cash in so grandly. The wealth was concentrated among executives, loan officers and brokers, because the greatest rewards were meted out in the form of commissions, bonuses and stock awards.“In the hot times, it was not unusual to see a broker make a million bucks,” said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. “You can carry that up further to people who ran the companies. The whole business revolves around personal compensation.”The hot times are clearly over.New Century’s disclosure of the federal investigations on Friday was the most serious in a string of shocks to have rocked the industry in the last three months.A handful of lenders have sought bankruptcy protection, several have been acquired and a few have been shut down. Also on Friday, Fremont General, a top-five lender, said it planned to leave the business.Industry officials say they are seeing an exodus of executives and salespeople as companies fold, cut jobs and push out early leaders.“Everyone has run for the hills,” said William D. Dallas, whose company, Ownit Mortgage, filed for bankruptcy protection in December after it lost financing from Merrill Lynch and other banks.For the borrowers of these mortgages, it may become more difficult to refinance if lending standards are tightened significantly. Many are already facing the prospect of payment shock when low, fixed-interest mortgage rates adjust to higher, variable rates.On Wall Street, big investment banks could lose a significant source of revenue if the appetite for bonds backed by mortgages dries up.In the last two years many skeptics began warning that the red-hot housing market and adjustable-rate loans would blend into a toxic brew. Last year, subprime loans totaled $600 billion, or about 20 percent of all mortgages, up from $120 billion and 5 percent in 2001, according to Inside Mortgage Finance. More than half of subprime loans have adjustable rates.Many of the problems that have surfaced thus far are not tied to the resetting of rates. Rather, they stem from a sharp and early spike in the default rates among loans issued last year.For example, about 13.8 percent of the loans in a group of mortgages New Century sold to investors in April were behind in payments or in foreclosure by January. By comparison, only 6 percent of loans in a pool sold to investors in March 2005 had met that same fate by January 2006.Investors and regulators fear that the problems will only worsen as so many borrowers have fallen behind so quickly, especially at a time when the overall economy is healthy. The phenomenon suggests that lending standards were significantly weakened last year and that lenders were not as watchful for fraudulent transactions.For New Century, the early payment defaults pose significant financial problems. In the first nine months of last year, Wall Street banks and investors that it does business with forced it to buy back $469 million in loans it had sold to them, up from $240 million for the same period in 2005.The company was able to sell back about half of those loans at a discount of 26.5 percent. How it handled the remainder — about $227 million — is now under scrutiny. According to accounting rules the company should have valued the loans on its books for what they were worth today, not their previous face value. But it did not.If it had, the company would have seen its earnings fall by about $60 million before taxes, wiping out most of its profit in the third quarter, according to Zach Gast, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensic accounting firm.This is important, because the company’s financing agreements require that it not lose money for any rolling six-month period. On Friday, New Century said it did not expect to make a profit in the six months that ended in December and that it was negotiating with lenders to waive the requirement but has only secured six of 11 waivers it needs.“They had losses sitting on their balance sheets,” Mr. Gast said.In August, the company’s chief financial officer, Patti M. Dodge, announced she was stepping down from her post to oversee investor relations, a department that typically reports to the chief financial officer. Taj S. Bindra, a former executive at Washington Mutual, replaced her in November.For the second time in a decade, New Century finds itself fighting to survive. The firm’s roots were planted at Plaza Home Mortgage Bank where the three founders of New Century — Mr. Cole, a longtime mortgage executive; Mr. Gotschall; and a lawyer named Bradley A. Morrice — worked together. The three formed New Century in 1995 after Plaza was sold to Fleet Mortgage Group, now a part of Washington Mutual.In the late 1990s, New Century narrowly survived accounting concerns and a scare in the bond market after Russia’ s default in 1998. It pulled through thanks to an investment by U.S. Bancorp, a bank based in Minneapolis.With interest rates at historic lows, it quickly grabbed a big share of the fast-growing subprime market during the housing boom.“They walked into a niche industry at a time when everything was lining up perfectly for what they did,” said W. Scott Simon, a managing director at Pimco Advisors. “In 2001, 2002 and 2003 the subprime business was just phenomenally profitable. Home prices kept appreciating and it seemed that no loans ever went bad.”"

12,"THE stock market took a breather after the wild ride a week ago, even in the face of plentiful economic data and more bad news on the subprime front. Radio stations agreed to a $12.5 million settlement with regulators, while a takeover battle brewed at Take-Two Interactive.For all the anxiety this week about what Wall Street would do once investors saw the latest economic indicators, there was little excitement in the markets.Stock prices were fairly subdued despite new data suggesting that inflation was rising and that both worker productivity and business activity in the service sector were slowing.The markets also shrugged off comments by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, that the chances of a recession this year were about one in three. Even the monthly jobs report from the Labor Department, a critical window on the health of the economy, moved the market little — perhaps because the data was less than clear-cut. Job growth slowed from January’s pace, but unemployment was down. JEREMY W. PETERSOn Friday, all eyes will be on the Consumer Price Index, which is expected to show a slight increase in inflation.The crisis in mortgage loans to people with weak, or subprime, credit intensified as a large lender, New Century Financial, stopped accepting loan applications because several of its financial backers cut off access to credit lines.Fremont General, another big subprime lender, has said that it will leave that business as part of an agreement with banking regulators. Several dozen mortgage companies have gone out of business because of high default rates on mortgages written last year when lending standards were significantly more relaxed. VIKAS BAJAJThe next few weeks will be critical for New Century as it seeks to persuade its banks to let it stay in business.Four of the nation’s biggest radio station owners moved to resolve accusations that programmers accepted bribes and other incentives to play specific songs on the air.As part of a settlement with the Federal Communications Commission, the four broadcasters — Clear Channel Communications, CBS, Entercom Communications and Citadel Broadcasting — agreed to pay a combined $12.5 million and to monitor more closely their programmers’ relationships with record labels.In a separate side deal, the broadcasters said they would play more music released through independent labels, which often lack the money and resources needed to promote songs to major radio broadcasters. JEFF LEEDSRecord executives are now watching to see how the broadcasters schedule the segments of independently released music they promised to play.After weeks of speculation and negotiations in Tokyo, Citigroup announced it would pay up to $10.8 billion for one of Japan’s largest brokerage firms, Nikko Cordial, in one of the biggest foreign takeovers of a Japanese company. The deal reflects Citigroup’s resurgence in Japan after losing its private banking license there in 2004 because of compliance problems.It will also move Citigroup into the ranks of the biggest players in the Japanese financial services market, giving it Nikko’s more than 100 retail branches and control of a joint-venture investment bank, Nikko Citigroup, one of the country’s top merger advisers. Nikko welcomed the bid after a scandal over inflated earnings. MARTIN FACKLERThe biggest question for Citigroup is whether Japanese investors will be as welcoming as Nikko. A previous effort by Merrill Lynch to build a retail presence in Japan failed.A consortium of investors in Take-Two Interactive, publisher of the wildly popular Grand Theft Auto video game franchise, disclosed plans to oust its board and possibly its senior management.The investors, including a group of hedge and mutual funds, own 46 percent of Take-Two.

13,"On March 1, a Wall Street analyst at Bear Stearns wrote an upbeat report on a company that specializes in making mortgages to cash-poor homebuyers. The company, New Century Financial, had already disclosed that a growing number of borrowers were defaulting, and its stock, at around $15, had lost half its value in three weeks.What happened next seems all too familiar to investors who bought technology stocks in 2000 at the breathless urging of Wall Street analysts. Last week, New Century said it would stop making loans and needed emergency financing to survive. The stock collapsed to $3.21.The analyst’s untimely call, coupled with a failure among other Wall Street institutions to identify problems in the home mortgage market, isn’t the only familiar ring to investors who watched the technology stock bubble burst precisely seven years ago.Now, as then, Wall Street firms and entrepreneurs made fortunes issuing questionable securities, in this case pools of home loans taken out by risky borrowers. Now, as then, bullish stock and credit analysts for some of those same Wall Street firms, which profited in the underwriting and rating of those investments, lulled investors with upbeat pronouncements even as loan defaults ballooned. Now, as then, regulators stood by as the mania churned, fed by lax standards and anything-goes lending.Investment manias are nothing new, of course. But the demise of this one has been broadly viewed as troubling, as it involves the nation’s $6.5 trillion mortgage securities market, which is larger even than the United States treasury market.Hanging in the balance is the nation’s housing market, which has been a big driver of the economy. Fewer lenders means many potential homebuyers will find it more difficult to get credit, while hundreds of thousands of homes will go up for sale as borrowers default, further swamping a stalled market.“The regulators are trying to figure out how to work around it, but the Hill is going to be in for one big surprise,” said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham-Fisher & Company, an independent investment research firm in New York, and an expert on mortgage securities. “This is far more dramatic than what led to Sarbanes-Oxley,” he added, referring to the legislation that followed the WorldCom and Enron scandals, “both in conflicts and in terms of absolute economic impact.”While real estate prices were rising, the market for home loans operated like a well-oiled machine, providing ready money to borrowers and high returns to investors like pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutions. Now this enormous and important machine is sputtering, and the effects are reverberating throughout Main Street, Wall Street and Washington.Already, more than two dozen mortgage lenders have failed or closed their doors, and shares of big companies in the mortgage industry have declined significantly. Delinquencies on loans made to less creditworthy borrowers — known as subprime mortgages — recently reached 12.6 percent. Some banks have reported rising problems among borrowers that were deemed more creditworthy as well.Traders and investors who watch this world say the major participants — Wall Street firms, credit rating agencies, lenders and investors — are holding their collective breath and hoping that the spring season for home sales will reinstate what had been a go-go market for mortgage securities. Many Wall Street firms saw their own stock prices decline over their exposure to the turmoil.“I guess we are a bit surprised at how fast this has unraveled,” said Tom Zimmerman, head of asset-backed securities research at UBS, in a recent conference call with investors.Even now the tone accentuates the positive. In a recent presentation to investors, UBS Securities discussed the potential for losses among some mortgage securities in a variety of housing markets. None of the models showed flat or falling home prices, however.The Bear Stearns analyst who upgraded New Century, Scott R. Coren, wrote in a research note that the company’s stock price reflected the risks in its industry, and that the downside risk was about $10 in a “rescue-sale scenario.” According to New Century, Bear Stearns is among the firms with a “longstanding” relationship financing its mortgage operation. Mr. Coren, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment.Others who follow the industry have voiced more caution. Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting, said: “It’s not that the mortgage industry is collapsing, it’s just that the mortgage industry went wild and there are consequences of going wild.“I think there is no doubt that home sales are going to be weaker than most anybody who was forecasting the market just two months ago thought. For those areas where the housing market was already not too great, where inventories were at historically high levels and it finally looked like things were stabilizing, this is going to be unpleasant.”Like worms that surface after a torrential rain, revelations that emerge when an asset bubble bursts are often unattractive, involving dubious industry practices and even fraud. In the coming weeks, some mortgage market participants predict, investors will learn not only how lax real estate lending standards became, but also how hard to value these opaque securities are and how easy their values are to prop up.Owners of mortgage securities that have been pooled, for example, do not have to reflect the prevailing market prices of those securities each day, as stockholders do. Only when a security is downgraded by a rating agency do investors have to mark their holdings to the market value. As a result, traders say, many investors are reporting the values of their holdings at inflated prices.“How these things are valued for portfolio purposes is exposed to management judgment, which is potentially arbitrary,” Mr. Rosner said.At the heart of the turmoil is the subprime mortgage market, which developed to give loans to shaky borrowers or to those with little cash to put down as collateral. Some 35 percent of all mortgage securities issued last year were in that category, up from 13 percent in 2003.Looking to expand their reach and their profits, lenders were far too willing to lend, as evidenced by the creation of new types of mortgages — known as “affordability products” — that required little or no down payment and little or no documentation of a borrower’s income. Loans with 40-year or even 50-year terms were also popular among cash-strapped borrowers seeking low monthly payments. Exceedingly low “teaser” rates that move up rapidly in later years were another feature of the new loans.The rapid rise in the amount borrowed against a property’s value shows how willing lenders were to stretch. In 2000, according to Banc of America Securities, the average loan to a subprime lender was 48 percent of the value of the underlying property. By 2006, that figure reached 82 percent.Mortgages requiring little or no documentation became known colloquially as “liar loans.” An April 2006 report by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, a consulting concern in Reston, Va., analyzed 100 loans in which the borrowers merely stated their incomes, and then looked at documents those borrowers had filed with the I.R.S. The resulting differences were significant: in 90 percent of loans, borrowers overstated their incomes 5 percent or more. But in almost 60 percent of cases, borrowers inflated their incomes by more than half.A Deutsche Bank report said liar loans accounted for 40 percent of the subprime mortgage issuance last year, up from 25 percent in 2001.Securities backed by home mortgages have been traded since the 1970s, but it has been only since 2002 or so that investors, including pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and other institutions, have shown such an appetite for them.Wall Street, of course, was happy to help refashion mortgages from arcane and illiquid securities into ubiquitous and frequently traded ones. Its reward is that it now dominates the market. While commercial banks and savings banks had long been the biggest lenders to home buyers, by 2006, Wall Street had a commanding share — 60 percent — of the mortgage financing market, Federal Reserve data show.The big firms in the business are Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank and UBS. They buy mortgages from issuers, put thousands of them into pools to spread out the risks and then divide them into slices, known as tranches, based on quality. Then they sell them.The profits from packaging these securities and trading them for customers and their own accounts have been phenomenal. At Lehman Brothers, for example, mortgage-related businesses contributed directly to record revenue and income over the last three years.The issuance of mortgage-related securities, which include those backed by home-equity loans, peaked in 2003 at more than $3 trillion, according to data from the Bond Market Association. Last year’s issuance, reflecting a slowdown in home price appreciation, was $1.93 trillion, a slight decline from 2005.In addition to enviable growth, the mortgage securities market has undergone other changes in recent years. In the 1990s, buyers of mortgage securities spread out their risk by combining those securities with loans backed by other assets, like credit card receivables and automobile loans. But in 2001, investor preferences changed, focusing on specific types of loans. Mortgages quickly became the favorite.Another change in the market involves its trading characteristics. Years ago, mortgage-backed securities appealed to a buy-and-hold crowd, who kept the securities on their books until the loans were paid off. “You used to think of mortgages as slow moving,” said Glenn T. Costello, managing director of structured finance residential mortgage at Fitch Ratings. “Now it has become much more of a trading market, with a mark-to-market bent.”The average daily trading volume of mortgage securities issued by government agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, exceeded $250 billion last year. That’s up from about $60 billion in 2000.Wall Street became so enamored of the profits in mortgages that it began to expand its reach, buying companies that make loans to consumers to supplement its packaging and sales operations. In August 2006, Morgan Stanley bought Saxon, a $6.5 billion subprime mortgage underwriter, for $706 million.And last September, Merrill Lynch paid $1.3 billion to buy First Franklin Financial, a home lender in San Jose, Calif. At the time, Merrill said it expected First Franklin to add to its earnings in 2007. Now analysts expect Merrill to take a large loss on the purchase.Indeed, on Feb. 28, as the first fiscal quarter ended for many big investment banks, Wall Street buzzed with speculation that the firms had slashed the value of their numerous mortgage holdings, recording significant losses.As prevailing interest rates remained low over the last several years, the appetite for these securities only rose. In the ever-present search for high yields, buyers clamored for securities that contained subprime mortgages, which carry interest rates that are typically one to two percentage points higher than traditional loans. Mortgage securities participants say increasingly lax lending standards in these loans became almost an invitation to commit mortgage fraud. It is too early to tell how significant a role mortgage fraud played in the rocketing delinquency rates — 12.6 percent among subprime borrowers. Delinquency rates among all mortgages stood at 4.7 percent in the third quarter of 2006.For years, investors cared little about risks in mortgage holdings. That is changing.“I would not be surprised if between now and the end of the year at least 20 percent of BBB and BBB- bonds that are backed by subprime loans originated in 2006 will be downgraded,” Mr. Lawler said.Still, the rating agencies have yet to downgrade large numbers of mortgage securities to reflect the market turmoil. Standard & Poor’s has put 2 percent of the subprime loans it rates on watch for a downgrade, and Moody’s said it has downgraded 1 percent to 2 percent of such mortgages that were issued in 2005 and 2006.Fitch appears to be the most proactive, having downgraded 3.7 percent of subprime mortgages in the period.The agencies say that they are confident that their ratings reflect reality in the mortgages they have analyzed and that they have required managers of mortgage pools with risky loans in them to increase the collateral. A spokesman for S.& P. said the firm made its ratings requirements more stringent for subprime issuers last summer and that they shored up the loans as a result.Meeting with Wall Street analysts last week, Terry McGraw, chief executive of McGraw-Hill, the parent of S.& P., said the firm does not believe that loans made in 2006 will perform “as badly as some have suggested.”Nevertheless, some investors wonder whether the rating agencies have the stomach to downgrade these securities because of the selling stampede that would follow. Many mortgage buyers cannot hold securities that are rated below investment grade — insurance companies are an example. So if the securities were downgraded, forced selling would ensue, further pressuring an already beleaguered market.Another consideration is the profits in mortgage ratings. Some 6.5 percent of Moody’s 2006 revenue was related to the subprime market.Brian Clarkson, Moody’s co-chief operating officer, denied that the company hesitates to cut ratings. “We made assumptions early on that we were going to have worse performance in subprime mortgages, which is the reason we haven’t seen that many downgrades,” he said. “If we have something that is investment grade that we need to take below investment grade, we will do it.”Interestingly, accounting conventions in mortgage securities require an investor to mark his holdings to market only when they get downgraded. So investors may be assigning higher values to their positions than they would receive if they had to go into the market and find a buyer. That delays the reckoning, some analysts say.“There are delayed triggers in many of these investment vehicles and that is delaying the recognition of losses,” Charles Peabody, founder of Portales Partners, an independent research boutique in New York, said. “I do think the unwind is just starting. The moment of truth is not yet here.”On March 2, reacting to the distress in the mortgage market, a throng of regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, asked lenders to tighten their policies on lending to those with questionable credit. Late last week, WMC Mortgage, General Electric’s subprime mortgage arm, said it would no longer make loans with no down payments.Meanwhile, investors wait to see whether the spring home selling season will shore up the mortgage market. If home prices do not appreciate or if they fall, defaults will rise, and pension funds and others that embraced the mortgage securities market will have to record losses. And they will likely retreat from the market, analysts said, affecting consumers and the overall economy.A paper published last month by Mr. Rosner and Joseph R. Mason, an associate professor of finance at Drexel University’s LeBow College of Business, assessed the potential problems associated with disruptions in the mortgage securities market. They wrote: “Decreased funding for residential mortgage-backed securities could set off a downward spiral in credit availability that can deprive individuals of home ownership and substantially hurt the U.S. economy.”"
14,"AFTER starting the year on a positive note, the markets began to backtrack on fears of economic troubles ahead. At the same time, a fresh round of geopolitical concerns pushed oil prices above $60 a barrel. And market volatility returned with a vengeance, raising fears that a full-blown market correction could be imminent.Does it all sound familiar? It should. Although this description outlines what happened in the equity markets recently, it could generally just as easily apply to the stock sell-off that occurred last May, when the Dow Jones industrial average fell by as much as 8 percent.But that market swoon never quite pushed stocks into an official correction, which is defined as a drop of 10 percent or more. Nor did the market stay rocky for long. So why do many strategists think that volatility has really returned this time around?For starters, Wall Street experienced a much more severe short-term drop during the most recent turbulence than it did last spring. The Dow industrials plunged 3.3 percent on Feb. 27, the biggest single-day loss for the benchmark index, in percentage terms, since March 2003. And history has shown that when stocks drop by 2 percent or more on a single day after a long period of relative calm, the decline often signals the start of a new era of rising volatility.Since 1959, volatility in the Standard & Poor’s 500 has risen 33 percent, on average, in the 12 months after similar 2 percent declines, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at S.& P.Of course, even if volatility climbs in coming months, as many market strategists predict, there are no guarantees the market will remain rocky for a long period. Last year, for example, when the markets began to slide on fears of a possible recession, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, jumped from a relatively low reading of about 12 in early May to as high as 23.8 in mid-June. (The average reading since 1996 has been 21.) But by August, the VIX had fallen back to around 12. And by November, it was below 10.In the current market turbulence, the VIX has risen as high as 19.6, though that is still low by historical standards.Nevertheless, David Kovacs, head of quantitative research at Turner Investment Partners in Berwyn, Pa., says he is convinced that “this is not another head fake.” This time around, he said, “there is a higher probability that volatility will increase, leading to a greater likelihood for a real correction.”Why? At least two things have changed since last spring. For starters, economists back then were simply talking about potential problems in the housing market — problems that might spill over into the larger economy. And the Federal Reserve was still raising short-term interest rates to keep inflation at bay, though the full effects of those rate increases had not yet been felt.Nearly a year has passed since those predictions of a potential housing meltdown. And there is ample evidence that at least a portion of the housing market — the so-called subprime market, which caters to borrowers with poor credit histories — is in a real crisis.The share prices of many subprime mortgage lenders have tumbled in recent days on fears of rising defaults. . One major player,Fremont General,has announced its intention to exit this high-risk market. Another, theNew Century FinancialCorporation, said Thursday that it had stopped accepting new loan applications while it negotiated with banks that had cut off its access to billions of dollars in funds.Mr. Kovacs said the crisis among subprime lenders gives investors who are embracing risk something to be truly scared about: an old-fashioned financial crisis, similar to the savings and loan debacle that caused a major market sell-off in the early 1990s or the Asian currency crisis that set off volatility on Wall Street in the late ’90s.But it is not just housing that is upsetting this stock market. Investors who have largely ignored risks in recent years have been leveraging their bets globally by borrowing Japanese yen — a move that costs them next to nothing in interest — and investing the proceeds in an assortment of higher-yielding assets. These include high-risk investments like emerging-markets stocks and commodities, which have been leading the global bull market of late.But now that risk is becoming a four-letter word on Wall Street, these assets have started to come back down to earth. And they could drop even more if investors continue to unwind their positions.This leaves investors with a difficult choice — whether to try to deal with volatility or to avoid the market altogether. Even though they may be motivated to sell, volatility is not necessarily bad. In fact, big movements in stock prices create buying and profit-taking opportunities for investors.If you are sticking with the stock market, you might consider the following advice:TAKE CARE WITH EMERGING MARKETSIf many investors grow worried about market risks, “this could cause a rapid unwinding of areas that outperformed recently, like the emerging markets,” said Tim Hayes, chief investment strategist at Ned Davis Research in Venice, Fla.What is more, many investors may already have too much emerging-markets exposure. Ronald Rogé, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y., says that you should keep only around 20 percent of your equity holdings in foreign shares — and only about 10 to 15 percent of that in the emerging markets.GO FOR BLUE CHIPS OVER SMALL STOCKSStrategists have been making this recommendation for years, with little success. But shares of large, industry-leading companies often hold up better in market storms. And because small stocks have been leading the markets for seven years, they have a lot more room to fall.DON’T GIVE UP ON GROWTH STOCKSThis may sound counterintuitive, since growth-oriented stocks are often associated with highflying companies, which could be risky in a tricky market. But Mr. Kovacs points out that many traditional value-oriented sectors are economically sensitive, including financial services, basic materials and industrial stocks. If volatility were to rise on fears of an economic slowdown, he said, you probably would not want to be in those areas.By contrast, Mr. Kovacs said health care, a traditional growth industry, is likely to outperform when market volatility is rising. According to a recent analysis by Ned Davis Research, health care stocks have been the best performers in the S.& P. 500 during periods of above-average volatility since 1972.After all, Mr. Kovacs said, “people still need to buy medications regardless of the economy."
15,"During a credit crisis nearly a decade ago, New Century Financial found a white knight in U.S. Bancorp, which was willing to save the company with a fresh infusion of capital.This time, no savior has appeared on the horizon for New Century, one of the biggest mortgage lenders to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit.Instead, the Wall Street banks and brokerage firms that just a few months ago welcomed New Century with open arms and gave it credit lines worth billions of dollars have quickly shut off the spigot, forcing it ever closer to bankruptcy.New Century said in a securities filing yesterday that all its lenders had frozen their credit lines and were demanding that it buy back $8.4 billion in loans that it issued using the money it borrowed from the banks — money New Century says it does not have.In the last few days, several lenders have held discussions with New Century about providing debtor-in-possession financing in connection with a bankruptcy filing, according to a person briefed on the situation. The company could then pursue a sale of itself or its assets through a bankruptcy filing, this person said.For Wall Street banks and brokerages firms, the stakes are much higher now than they were a decade ago. In 1998, U.S. Bancorp saved New Century by acquiring 17 percent of the company for a mere $20 million.The closest thing to a white knight for New Century, which experienced a 90 percent tumble in its stock price this year before trading was halted yesterday, had been Morgan Stanley, which offered a financing package totaling $975 million last week.But even that lifeline has not been enough.What is perhaps most remarkable about New Century’s troubles is the speed at which its banks acted. Their quick about-face appears to have been a response to the rapid demise of the subprime segment of the mortgage business, where default rates have spiked in the last six months.In the next two weeks, many large Wall Street banks will report first-quarter earnings, and they may make the case that their exposure to the subprime sector will be limited, in part, because they have acted quickly to stop financing mortgage companies that relaxed lending standards last year.The banks also have been driven by a fear that if they did not move as quickly as other banks, they would find themselves compromised when and if New Century filed for bankruptcy protection, according to analysts and people with knowledge about negotiations between New Century and its lenders.“It’s just a question of confidence,” said Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, a forensics accounting firm that has been following New Century’s troubles. “Once the first person went, we thought everybody would go. You don’t want to be the last one holding the loans.”The banks also appear to have been caught unawares by the scope of New Century’s problems. For instance, a week after the company said it would have to restate its financial statements for the first nine months of last year, Goldman Sachs extended to May 14 a credit line to New Century that was set to expire on Feb. 15.Goldman Sachs agreed to extend its credit line after nearly two weeks of negotiations with New Century. The extension was for just three months, and the investment bank changed aspects of the agreement to give itself greater control over the relationship and allow it to get out of the agreement at the first hint of trouble, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Goldman was not alone in betting, at least initially, that New Century might prevail even as the company sent signals that something was amiss.On Feb. 19, Citigroup acquired 5.1 percent of New Century, a stake that was worth about $55.2 million then, on behalf of individual and institutional clients.Over the next few days, New Century received notice from the market trading analysis division of the New York Stock Exchange that it was examining trading in the company’s stock. The trading also landed the company on the radar of prosecutors with the United States attorney’s office in Santa Ana, Calif., who began an investigation on Feb. 28.Two days later, after the close of the markets on Friday, New Century announced the various investigations into trading of its stock and also disclosed it had most likely breached its lending agreements with Wall Street and was working to receive waivers of those covenants.Yet, the warning flags had already gone up inside at least two of New Century’s lenders — Goldman and Citigroup.On March 6, Citigroup demanded New Century put up more cash through a $80.3 million margin call and demanded that the company buy back $717 million in loans that had been financed through Citigroup’s line of credit.About that same time and just weeks after renewing a line of credit with New Century, Goldman also made a margin call and sent notice to the company that it was in default of its credit arrangements.That same day in a conference call with all of its banks, New Century said it had received margin calls from a number of its lenders and that it paid some but would not be able to honor them all, according to a person briefed on the call.New Century and its lenders declined to comment beyond the company’s securities filing.With little cash on its balance sheet, New Century scrambled to find financing to meet the margin calls. Help came from Morgan Stanley, which provided $265 million in new financing and replaced Citigroup’s $717 million credit line.The move — a doubling down of its position — surprised some of New Century’s bankers, who speculated Morgan Stanley might try to acquire the company.Others briefed on the negotiations, however, say that Citigroup’s line of credit was better collateralized than some of the other banks’ line of credit with a combination of loans made by New Century and a higher yielding pool of securities.Morgan Stanley has most likely improved its standing as a lender in a possible bankruptcy, said Mr. Gast from the Center for Financial Research and Analysis. He estimates the $265 million in financing, for instance, was secured by a loan portfolio worth about $512 million.If New Century files for bankruptcy protection, as many analysts expect, and then seeks to sell some assets, banks and investors might be interested. But they would probably want to get a better sense of how the loans are performing before they make any offers.“I could see people wanting to go in and doing an asset sale under that scenario,” Mr. Gast said. “I don’t see a lot of scenarios where people would want to assume the liabilities.”"

17,"NEW YORK —Concerns about the U.S. housing market deepened Tuesday, punctuated by a report that specified the extent of the widening crisis, weighing heavily on Wall Street.The percentage of homeowners who were unable to make their mortgage payments increased noticeably in the fourth quarter and shot up significantly among people with weak, or subprime, credit, according to a report released Tuesday by the Mortgage Bankers Association.The group reported that 4.95 percent of all homes were past due in the last three months of the year, up from 4.67 percent in the third quarter and 4.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2005.But the number of loans past due in the troubled subprime market, which caters largely to poor and minority borrowers, rose to 13.33 percent, up from 12.56 percent in the third quarter.The serious delinquency rate, which includes loans that are in foreclosure and 90 or more days past due, jumped to 7.78 percent, from 6.78 percent.All three major markets dropped sharply on subprime lending. The financial sector was hit particularly hard in the market decline. All 88 companies of the S&P financials index — including Goldman Sachs, which reported 29 percent increase in first-quarter profit Tuesday — traded lower.Mortgage default rates are at their highest point since 2002 and early 2003, when the economy was much weaker than it is today and unemployment was hovering close to 6 percent.By comparison, the unemployment rate at the end of last year was 4.5 percent and incomes were growing at a pace faster than inflation for the first time in several years.Industry experts and officials said the current rise in default rates was a function of loose lending practices by mortgage companies in the last few years and the end of the housing boom last year, rather than the more traditional economic weakness that drove up defaults in the past.As sales fell, the number of homes on the market rose and home prices began to weaken last year, borrowers had a harder time selling or refinancing their properties.Some, though experts say it is hard to say exactly how many, probably also had payment shock from the resetting of adjustable rate mortgages.These developments have proven to be most severe for subprime borrowers who typically have a poor credit history, a high debt burden and do not have stable jobs.In the last five years, loans to this group of people have increased significantly from about $120 billion in 2001 to $600 billion last year, according to Inside Mortgage Finance.Already, dozens of small companies that specialized in subprime lending have gone out of business because of rising default rates, and several large ones have stopped making loans.One of those companies, New Century Financial, has lost the financial support of many Wall Street banks. On Tuesday, trading in its shares was suspended by the New York Stock Exchange and it said it received a grand jury subpoena in a U.S. criminal probe. New Century also is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.Another lender, Accredited Home Lenders, saw its share price fall by more than half on Tuesday. The company said it was facing a cash squeeze because of margin calls from its banks and requests for it to buy back mortgages that it sold to other financial institutions.Accredited Home Lenders said it was considering ""strategic alternatives"" including raising more capital and cutting costs by laying off more workers. Shares in the company fell $7.43, or 65 percent, to $3.97.""There's not going to be many independent subprime lenders left,"" said Blake Howells, director of research at Becker Capital Management."
18,"Stocks fell broadly and sharply yesterday afternoon after a report on mortgage defaults indicated that the troubled housing market will weaken further before showing signs of improvement.Though default and foreclosure rates have only recently begun rising from historic lows, the report from the Mortgage Bankers Association unnerved investors because it showed that a record number of homes entered the foreclosure process in the fourth quarter. It also indicated that problems that had previously been limited to economically weak areas were cropping up in more vibrant places like California.With shares of financial companies leading the way, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 242.66 points, or 1.97 percent, to 12,075.96, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 28.65 points, or 2.04 percent, to 1,377.95. The fallout continued in Asia, with shares declining 1 percent to 3 percent in the major markets in mid-day trading today.The slide echoed a sell-off two weeks ago driven in part by concerns about mortgages made to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit and by a 9 percent drop in the Shanghai market. The S.& P. and Dow indexes are now down more than 5 percent since Feb. 20. [Page C11.]Yesterday’s report by the mortgage bankers found that about 0.54 percent of all home loans entered foreclosure in the fourth quarter, the highest ever in the 37-year history of the survey. The problems were most heavily concentrated among subprime mortgages, but the default rates also increased on loans made to prime borrowers and on loans that are part of government programs.“It’s a measurable weakening in credit quality across the board,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com.The rise in delinquencies will further strain the housing market, he said, because more houses will be put up for sale as foreclosures end in auctions, driving down home prices, which in turn will make it harder for struggling homeowners to refinance or sell their properties.“This has a long way to play out,” he said, “because it now has this self-reinforcing quality that is seemingly kicking in and will extend the housing correction.”Delinquency and foreclosure rates were highest in states like Ohio and Indiana, which are suffering from the loss of high-paying manufacturing jobs, and Louisiana and Mississippi on the Gulf Coast, where a slow pace of reconstruction has worsened the pain from hurricane damage.But defaults were growing, albeit from a low base, even in relatively prosperous California, the nation’s most populous state and home to some of its most heated housing markets until recently. About 2.03 percent of subprime mortgages in California entered foreclosure, which is more than the 1.83 percent of loans that were already in foreclosure there during the third quarter. Homes typically stay in foreclosure for several months.Around the country, big states like Massachusetts, Colorado, Georgia and Texas also had high and rising foreclosure rates. The state statistics are not seasonally adjusted, unlike the national data.The center of the country is exhibiting an “early warning sign of an infection that will quickly enough get to the coasts,” said Edward Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. Both Mr. Leamer and Mr. Zandi noted that they did not expect the mortgage problems to presage a recession as long as the job market remained healthy.Still, the mounting troubles of subprime lenders have been raising fears of a broader financial fallout. New Century Financial, one of the biggest subprime lenders, said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission and a federal grand jury were seeking documents in investigations into trading in its shares and accounting errors. New Century stopped making loans last week after Wall Street banks closed off its financing.Another subprime company, Accredited Home Lenders, said that it was facing a cash squeeze because of margin calls from its banks and was considering ""strategic alternatives.” Shares in the company fell 65.2 percent, to $3.97.Residential Capital, the mortgage division of GMAC, reported an operating loss of $651 million for the fourth quarter, in contrast to a profit of $118 million a year ago, because of rising losses and reserves for future losses in its subprime business. General Motors will inject $1 billion into GMAC as a result.According to the mortgage bankers’ survey, 6.14 percent of all home loans were past due or in foreclosure in the fourth quarter, up from 5.72 percent. The portion of subprime loans, which are given largely to poor and minority borrowers, past due or in foreclosure rose to 17.86 percent, from 16.42 percent.The default rates are at their highest since 2002 and early 2003, when the economy was a lot weaker than it is today and unemployment was hovering close to 6 percent. By comparison, at the end of last year the unemployment rate was 4.5 percent.Senator Christopher Dodd, the Connecticut Democrat who is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the government might have to step in to provide aid to struggling homeowners. “The impact of losing 2.2 million homes I suspect will be in a lot of areas of our cities and towns that are already pretty hard hit,” Mr. Dodd told reporters after a speech at the National League of Cities, according to Bloomberg News.Douglas G. Duncan, the chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said default rates were rising and would probably peak at the end of 2007 because about half the mortgages today were issued less than three years ago and borrowers are most vulnerable during the third and fourth years of their loans.Other industry experts add that the current rise in defaults is also a function of looser lending practices in the last two or three years. Many lenders made loans without requiring down payments or verifying borrowers’ incomes with tax statements or pay stubs. Some borrowers — though it is hard to say precisely how many — may have also experienced payment shock from the resetting of adjustable-rate mortgages.Furthermore, the slowing housing market has made it harder for borrowers to sell their properties or refinance, because their homes may be worth less than the outstanding balance on their loans.Dozens of small companies that specialized in subprime lending have gone out of business or stopped making loans. Other companies like Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, are tightening standards.In an appearance on CNBC, Angelo Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, said investors were overreacting to the subprime problems. “This is now becoming a liquidity crisis, an unnecessary one,” he said. “There’s been a rush to judgment.”A top executive at Goldman Sachs, which was among the investment banks that financed subprime lenders, said credit problems appeared to be safely confined to the subprime category.“I can’t predict the future, but as we sit here today, we really have not seen any contagion to the credit markets,” David A. Viniar, Goldman’s chief financial officer, said during a conference call with analysts and journalists about the firm’s record quarterly profits.But investors pushed Goldman shares down 1.8 percent, to $199.03."
19,"NEW DELHI, March 15 — Asian and European stock markets tumbled today, following the sharp drop in U.S. stocks on Tuesday, as concerns spread about the consequences of loose lending practices in the United States housing market.Most markets in Asia closed down between 2 and 3 percent. It was their biggest drop since the sharp declines two weeks ago that were triggered by the sell-off in China on February 27.Investors sold Asian and European equities after U.S. stocks fell significantly on Tuesday due to concerns about home loans made to borrowers with bad credit histories. An American mortgage association said Tuesday that a record number of homes entered the foreclosure process at the end of last year.The Dow Jones industrial average ended the day Tuesday down 1.97 percent, and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 2.04 percent. Shares of financial companies led the way.Today in Asia, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index closed down 2.57 percent at 18,836.93. Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 was down 2.92 percent at 16,676.89, and Standard & Poor’s Australia index dropped 2.1 percent to close at 5,741.90.After Asia’s sharp falls, European stocks opened weak. By early afternoon trading today, Britain’s FTSE 100 index was down by 1.5 percent, at 6,070. Germany’s DAX Index was down 108, or 1.6 percent, to 6,514, and the CAC 40 Index in France dropped 78 points, or 1.4 percent, to 5,355.Francis Lun, general manager of Fulbright Securities in Hong Kong, said that the crisis in the U.S. housing market was having a “destructive effect on global financial markets around the world.”After several months of smooth climbing, Asian equity investors have been treated to a bumpy ride in recent weeks. They could face even more volatility in the future, analysts say.Asian markets have been flooded with liquidity in the past 24 months, thanks to a combination of domestic investors, hedge funds, and proprietary trading desks at banks. Many of these investors trade on the movement of market indices, exacerbating stock drops and heightening their jumps.The shares of banks and lending institutions in Asia were hard hit today, as were companies that make consumer goods. The number of United States consumers who are late paying off their home loans is climbing steadily, particularly among borrowers with a history of credit problems, known as subprime borrowers.Asian investors and economists predict that these consumers will stop buying new cars, electronics and other goods, hurting Asian economies.Japan’s Chiba Bank closed down 4.31 percent to 1,022 yen today, and Sony Corp dropped 4.09 percent to 5,869 yen.HSBC Holdings, the British bank, dropped 1.5 percent in Hong Kong to HK$135.HSBC has been hurt by United States housing market problems after it bought Household International in 2003, a United States lender that specializes in loans to borrowers with bad credit. On Feb. 7, HSBC shocked investors when it said it was setting aside $1.76 billion to cover potential mortgage losses in America, 20 percent more than analysts estimated.The drumbeat of bad consumer news from the United States, where more than 1 in 10 subprime home borrowers are late paying back their loans, is having an effect on investors’ appetite for risky stocks, analysts say.“Investors are becoming a bit more risk adverse,” said Yiping Huang, economic and market analysis with Citigroup Global Markets Asia.In Europe today, investors’ worries about continuing negative news concerning the American economy, including possible slower earnings growth, were behind the stock market declines, analysts said.“Even though European earnings have been much more robust and Europe has not suffered the same problems in banking and consumer behavior as the U.S., if the U.S. is going in a slowdown direction then that is the main driver,” Andrew Lapthorne, a research analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in London, said.Mortgage lenders in Europe, where the sub-prime lending market is far less developed, have not suffered as much as their American counterparts.Annik Lambert, secretary general of the European Mortgage Federation, said that sub-prime lending is not as much of a problem in Europe because consumer protection legislation prevents financial institutions from granting loans with interest rates above a certain level.Nevertheless, investors in Europe are concerned about earnings growth at banks.In Britain, higher interest rates and rising costs for gas and electricity have pushed personal insolvencies to record levels.Lloyds TSB Group, the biggest provider of consumer loans in Britain, said last month that its consumer and mortgage lending was decelerating.Meanwhile, the Bank of England’s three interest-rate increases since August have so far failed to cool the property market, meaning that consumers are still willing to take on debt, although at a slower rate. despite the interest rates rises."

Both the Dow and the S&P 500 opened slightly higher, fell back, and then recovered;at times, the Dow was off by more than 100 points.Asian markets closed down between 2 percent and 3 percent, the biggest drop since the sharp declines two weeks ago that were triggered by a sell- off in China on Feb. 27, while major bourses in Europe closed down more than 2 percent.""Even though European earnings have been much more robust and Europe has not suffered the same problems in banking and consumer behavior than the U.S.,"" said Andrew Lapthorne, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort in London, ""if the U.S. is going in a slowdown direction than that is the main driver.""Mortgage lenders in Europe, where the subprime lending market is far less developed, have not suffered as much as their U.S. counterparts.

23,"Wall Street started pulling itself back up from yesterday’s sharp fall, with stocks closing slightly higher today.It was a day of erratic trading as share prices gained then dropped, and gained again. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 130 points and fell below the 12,000 threshold for the first time since November. But by late afternoon, stocks recovered their losses and finished the day with modest gains. The Dow closed up 57.4 points, or about 0.5 percent, at 12,133.40. The broader Standard and Poor’s 500-stock index rose 9.2 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,387.17.

25,"INVESTORS this week showed that while they are still ready to sell at a moment’s notice, they remain unpredictable.On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 242.66 points after the Mortgage Bankers Association issued a report indicating that a record number of homes have entered the foreclosure process, adding to fears about subprime mortgages.On Thursday, however, investors shrugged at a report that producer prices surged in February against all expectations, and focused instead on indications that the problem of subprime loans would not spread to other markets. Yesterday, the markets fell slightly on news that consumer prices, led by energy, also rose.Subprime loans continued to haunt New Century Financial, which said its banks had frozen its lines of credit. The former newspaper baron Conrad M. Black went on trial. Viacom sued Google. Patricia C. Dunn, formerly of Hewlett-Packard, dodged a bullet. And a surprise bid upset the planned merger of two big financial exchanges.FROZEN OUTNew Century Financial said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that all its lenders had cut off credit and had demanded that the firm buy back $8.4 billion in loans. New Century said it could not do so, because it did not have the money.The banks’ attitude toward New Century is different from nearly a decade ago, when U.S. Bancorp bailed the company out. But the stakes are much higher this time, with default rates among subprime loans having spiked in the last six months. Trading in New Century shares was halted this week, their value having tumbled by 90 percent since the beginning of the year.Many large Wall Street banks began reporting first-quarter earnings late this week, and they wanted to be sure they could tell investors that their exposure to subprime loans was limited. So far, that’s what they have done. Bear Stearns said as much on Thursday, sending its stock on an upward swing.Morgan Stanley, which last week offered New Century a financing package worth $975 million, will report earnings next week. Some analysts said the offer was a tactic to better position Morgan Stanley in the event that New Century files for bankruptcy.BLACK ON TRIALThe fraud trial of Conrad M. Black, the former chairman of Hollinger International, got under way in Chicago. Mr. Black is behaving differently from other corporate executives facing trial. He’s given dozens of interviews, made speeches and written articles chastising his accusers.Although many Americans have never heard of Mr. Black, the trial is a huge story in his native Canada. Hollinger, now called The Sun-Times Media Group, until recently owned several large Canadian daily newspapers as well as The Daily Telegraph in London, The Jerusalem Post and The Chicago Sun-Times. The trial is being held in Chicago because the company is registered there.If convicted, Mr. Black faces more than 90 years in prison. He is accused of paying himself unauthorized bonuses, of accepting improper payments from buyers of newspapers sold by Hollinger, and of misappropriating company funds for personal use.Mr. Black said any improprieties were either a result of sloppy accounting or the fault of his former friend and partner, F. David Radler, who agreed to plead guilty to the charges and testify against Mr. Black.The trial, which is expected to last two to three months, will have Henry A. Kissinger and Donald J. Trump as witnesses.WEB VIDEO SHOWDOWNViacom stepped up the pressure on Google by accusing it in a $1 billion lawsuit of “massive copyright infringement.” The lawsuit also seeks to prohibit Google from committing further infringement via its YouTube online video service.Google purchased YouTube last year for $1.65 billion on the expectation that it would make revenue-sharing deals with media companies whose content YouTube users upload to the site alongside home-produced videos. So far, Google has struck licensing deals with smaller media companies and limited agreements with larger ones. The company is in talks with other big media companies, but many of them are becoming frustrated with YouTube users’ uploading their copyrighted content even as negotiations continue.Viacom demanded last month that Google remove more than 100,000 clips of programs it owns like “The Daily Show With John Stewart” and “South Park.”Google reaffirmed its position that it complies with copyright law that protects Web sites as long as it promptly removes content when asked to do so by the owner.It is widely thought among analysts and media experts that the lawsuit is mostly a negotiating tactic meant to force Google into a licensing agreement. Legal experts are split on the merits of the case.CHARGES DISMISSEDA judge in California dismissed four felony counts against Patricia C. Dunn, the former chairwoman of Hewlett-Packard.Ms. Dunn and several others had been accused of illicit spying to try to discover the source of leaks of inside company information.The charges against Ms. Dunn were dropped after several weeks of negotiations with California’s new state attorney general, Jerry Brown, the former California governor and the former mayor of Oakland. Misdemeanor charges against Kevin T. Hunsaker, a former company lawyer; and two private investigators, Ronald R. DeLia and Matthew DePante, will be dropped after they each perform 96 hours of community service.The private investigators had been accused of “pretexting” — misrepresenting themselves to obtain the phone records of journalists and Hewlett-Packard directors. Ms. Dunn was accused of authorizing that tactic.Hewlett-Packard’s annual meeting happened to be held this week. Mark V. Hurd, the chairman and chief executive, indicated that he wanted to put the company’s legal woes behind it and to focus on the future.BIDDING UPThe Intercontinental Exchange made a surprise $10 billion bid for the Chicago Board of Trade in an attempt to spoil the board’s planned merger with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.The bid from Intercontinental Exchange, or ICE, topped the value of the Chicago exchanges’ pending deal by $2 billion. The merger of the two longtime Chicago rivals would create the world’s largest market for financial derivatives.The offer from ICE, which specializes in trading energy contracts, is an indication that the Board of Trade-Mercantile Exchange merger might not survive regulatory scrutiny, according to analysts and one person close to ICE.Analysts also said the Mercantile Exchange might have a hard time topping ICE’s offer, but that with so much already invested, it will have little choice but to try.MOST POPULARFollowing are the most popular business news articles on nytimes.com from March 10 through March 16:1.Crisis Looms in Market for Mortgages2.Google Buses Help Its Workers Beat the Rush3.Getting Out of a 2-Year Cellphone Contract Alive4.One Number That Will Ring All Your Phones5.Guidelines for Using a Cellphone Abroad"
26,"New Century Financial, once the nation’s largest independent provider of subprime mortgages, was dealt a fresh setback yesterday when Fannie Mae said it would no longer buy its loans made to borrowers with poor credit.In a related matter, People’s Choice, a privately held subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy protection, joining more than two dozen home financiers that have sought Chapter 11 status since the crisis involving subprime lenders came to national attention late last year.Last week, the Mortgage Bankers Association reported a record number of United States home loans going into foreclosure in the fourth quarter, led by the subprime category.In a hopeful sign yesterday, Accredited Home Lenders Holding, which has been struggling, said it had won fresh financing from a San Francisco hedge fund, helping it avert an immediate cash crisis. The news bolstered hopes that some investors might see bargains in the battered group.But Wells Fargo, which has been the largest American subprime lender though it never made some of the riskiest loans, said it was eliminating 121 jobs at a unit in Tempe, Ariz., that offers mortgages to higher-risk borrowers, on top of 323 previously announced job cuts in other offices of its home loan unit.Many other subprime lenders have been cutting jobs or announcing layoffs in recent weeks, including Fremont General, NovaStar Financial and the WMC Mortgage unit of General Electric.For New Century, Fannie Mae’s decision was a new blow to a company whose lending practices are already under scrutiny by investigators in a number of states.Fannie Mae severed business ties with New Century, meaning that the lender can no longer sell its loans to the leading American packager and reseller of mortgages.New Century has managed so far to avoid a bankruptcy filing, but investors seemed to be losing faith in its chances of continuing to do so. The news yesterday sent its stock down 22 percent, to $1.69.People’s Choice became the latest subprime casualty, a group that includes Mortgage Lenders Network USA, Ownit Mortgage Solutions and ResMae Mortgage, which have already filed for bankruptcy protection.Shares of many subprime lenders have dropped sharply in recent weeks as a rising wave of delinquencies prompted Wall Street investment banks to cut off a big source of funds to the group.But shares of Accredited rose after it said it secured a five-year, $200 million loan from Farallon Capital Management. The loan carries an interest rate of 13 percent. Accredited’s stock closed up $1.82, or 20 percent, at $10.77.Any news of financing for the endangered lenders or even of stability in the housing market seems lately to have been a rallying point for investors.Also lifting sentiment was a report by the Commerce Department that the pace of home construction rose 9 percent in February, surpassing forecasts. But building permits were below expectations, extending a downward trend and limiting optimism about a sustained upturn in housing.Subprime lenders are coming under increasing pressure from Washington as well. On Monday, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee and a presidential aspirant, said that he had asked executives at the top five subprime companies to explain their lending practices at a hearing on Thursday.The companies are New Century, HSBC Holdings, Countrywide Financial, WMC Mortgage and First Franklin."
27,"SEOUL —Subprime lending was going out of fashion in South Korea well before the U.S. crisis struck.Now it looks set to shrink even further.The industry, which offers consumer and mortgage loans to the riskiest borrowers, is in crisis in the United States as default levels have risen, squeezing lenders and sending shivers through global markets.But in South Korea, loans from subprime players and others outside the mainstream lending industry represent only 5.5 percent of the country's gross domestic product, compared with 20 percent for the United States, according to Samsung Securities.A crackdown on mortgages since late last year, aimed at cooling red-hot property prices, has been slowing demand for home loans this year, regulatory data show. Government plans to tighten rules on the subprime sector will cap the sector's growth further.As a result, the $50 billion industry, led by global banks like Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and Citigroup, was already seeing a drop in demand, said Jang Byoung In, president of the mortgage lender GEM Investment Finance.""Should the current slowdown in the property market continue for one year, more than half our subprime mortgage lenders may shut down their shops in the first half of next year,"" he said.Further insulating South Korea from a subprime ripple effect is the fact that the loans are not widely held, in contrast to the United States, where a wide range of investors bought subprime lenders' securitized assets.""It's not as developed as in the United States,"" said Jason Yu, analyst at Samsung Securities. ""We have no securitization on subprime loans nor CDS,"" or credit default swaps, for them.South Korea is one of the few Asian countries with a significant subprime market.Nearly a quarter of South Korea's 17,000 registered subprime lenders offer mortgage loans, estimated at a total of $3.2 billion, according to the Korea Finance Union, which represents them.Including mom-and-pop stores offering personal loans, the country has an estimated 40,000 subprime lenders.Subprime mortgages outstanding are a tiny fraction of the subprime lenders' total credit, with credit loans making up the bulk of their loans.Home buyers tend to use subprime loans to meet a temporary shortage of money, as banks have lowered their lending ceilings, so subprime lenders can charge an annual average of 18 percent, more than double the banks' rates, and as much as 36 percent in some cases.There are virtually no entrance barriers to subprime business, as players can just register at municipal governments to start lending. Still, because South Korea has a history of loose consumer credit lending, as evidenced by the devastating credit card crisis of 2003-4, government and regulators have been examining the sector.The mortgage industry overall has prospered in the past four years as surging home prices in and around Seoul have spurred younger people to rush in to own property.But Jang of GEM Investment said a downturn was on the way, and lenders are already working to squeeze out the bubble they fear is forming.""We cannot accept the current market price of homes,"" Jang said. ""We have to cut the collateral's value by 10 percent"" for a realistic valuation, he said.House prices across South Korea rose 11.6 percent in 2006, their fastest pace since a 16.4 percent gain in 2002. But in February, growth in home prices slowed for the first time in half a year.People are delaying plans to buy amid growing expectations that home prices will drop sharply because of a lowering of the ceiling for mortgage loans and heavy taxes on transactions.""If the property price bubble bursts and house prices turn lower,"" said an analyst at Mirae Asset Securities, Han Jeong Tae, ""those subprime lenders who had lent up to 100 percent of the property's value could not help but take a severe beating."" That would lead to a spate of small-scale bankruptcies that could further depress overall housing sentiment in the country."

29,"WASHINGTON —The Federal Reserve could have acted faster to prevent a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market by curbing the lax lending standards that contributed to the crisis, the Fed's chief bank supervisor said Thursday.""Given what we know now, yes, we could have done more sooner,"" Roger Cole, the Fed's director of banking supervision and regulation, told the Senate Banking Committee in Washington as regulators testified for the first time before the U.S. Congress on the market rout.Lawmakers called the hearing amid growing concern that the deterioration of subprime lending would spread to regular mortgages and even into the broader economy by cutting into consumer spending.Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat, pressed Cole and other regulators to explain whether supervisory and enforcement lapses helped lead to the turmoil in the subprime market that had driven delinquencies to a four-year high. The regulators said that while they had taken some enforcement action, they had placed the main responsibility on lenders to police themselves.""I don't want this to go on any longer — this has got to stop,"" Dodd said, urging the Fed to use its authority to end abusive lending. ""Regulators were supposed to be the cops on the beat, protecting hard-working Americans from unscrupulous financial actors. Yet they were spectators for far too long.""Borrowers were late on more than 13 percent of subprime mortgage payments last quarter, the highest delinquency rate since September 2002, the Mortgage Bankers Association said last week. Delinquencies on all mortgages were the most since June 2003.Subprime home loans are made to borrowers with poor or limited credit ratings or high debt burdens. Looser underwriting standards and slowing home- price gains left subprime lenders holding bad loans.A regulator of the biggest U.S. banks said fraud contributed to the surge in delinquencies.""It is clear that some subprime lenders have engaged in abusive practices, and we share the committee's strong concerns about them,"" said Emory Rushton, senior deputy comptroller in the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.Dodd called Brendan McDonagh, the HSBC Finance chief executive, before the committee and the panel also included executives from Countrywide Financial, the General Electric unit WMC Mortgage and First Franklin.New Century Mortgage refused to send a witness, according to Dodd.Congress and regulators should ""be careful about an overcorrection"" that would further curtail access to credit for subprime borrowers, Sandy Samuels, executive managing director at Countrywide, told the committee.Laurent Bossard, the chief executive of WMC Mortgage, said that his bank was improving its loan underwriting. WMC this month raised its minimum credit scores for mortgage applicants.The Fed's failure to decisively act on early signs of trouble in subprime mortgage lending put 2.2 million borrowers at risk of losing their homes, Dodd said. The recent delinquencies are just ""the tip of the iceberg,"" said Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama, the committee's senior Republican.Data collected by the Federal Reserve Board clearly indicated that lenders had started easing standards by early 2004, Dodd said. He asked why the central bank did not issue directives to banks that they ""make sure that the borrower is going to be able to fully meet"" the higher payments that follow low introductory rates.Cole said that the Fed tried to stem faulty subprime lending at some institutions under its jurisdiction.""As we saw the problems developing, we did increase our focus on efforts to review what the banking industry and mortgage originators under our responsibility were doing,"" he told Dodd. Beginning in 2003, the Fed took three formal and three informal enforcement actions to stop predatory lending and ""ill-advised"" subprime lending."

31,"Morgan Stanley said yesterday that it would auction $2.48 billion of residential mortgages from the troubled subprime lender New Century Financial.The New Century loans are collateral pledged to Morgan Stanley for a $2.5 billion credit line; about $2.48 billion of the line was used to make loans.At least two other large subprime lenders, Accredited Home Lenders Holding and Fremont General, announced agreements this month to sell subprime loans at a steep discount to raise cash.According to a public notice, Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital will auction a portfolio of about 13,200 loans originated by New Century, Home123 Corporation and other affiliates with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of $2.48 billion.First-round bids for the loans are due Thursday, and the top three parties will be invited to submit final offers. Morgan Stanley reserves the right to enter its own bid in the final round.Securities backed by subprime mortgages, made to borrowers with damaged credit, have sunk in value in recent weeks as investors have grown worried about rising delinquencies and their potential impact on the broader American housing market.New Century, based in Irvine, Calif., stopped making loans two weeks ago, and said it had less than $60 million in cash on hand. Many analysts have said the company appears on the brink of bankruptcy. At least four large subprime lenders have sought bankruptcy protection since late December.Some investors also fear that the subprime mortgage crisis could spread to higher-rated mortgages, or even other sectors, like autos.In a recent report, Standard & Poor’s said that a slight increase in delinquent payments on subprime auto loans may be “an initial trickle-down of the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis.”Homeowners with subprime mortgages may face difficulty making payments on auto loans as interest rates on their adjustable-rate mortgages reset higher.Mark Risi, an S.& P. analyst, said, however, that the fallout from deterioration in the subprime mortgage industry might ultimately be limited for auto loans because a majority of subprime auto borrowers are renters, not homeowners."
32,"After breaking the record for mergers and acquisitions last year, deal makers have started 2007 at an even faster pace.With the first quarter drawing to a close, the value of corporate deals announced through Wednesday reached $1.08 trillion, according to Thomson Financial. That is 24 percent more than the value of deals in the first quarter of 2006.The tempo has slowed from last year’s fourth quarter, when $1.2 trillion in transactions were announced. But the deal cycle is seasonal, and fourth quarters have been the busiest ones for announcements in recent years — a trend that could partly reflect a desire by investment bankers to plump up their year-end bonuses.Many of the conditions favorable to deals remain in place, including an accommodating credit market and an abundance of well-financed private equity firms.“We are still in an accelerating mode,” said Robert Filek, a partner in the transaction services group at the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers. He added that deals this year could break the record set in 2006, when there were about $3.8 trillion in announced transactions — up 38 percent from 2005.Last year’s abundance helped produce an especially rich bonus season for bankers.But February and March brought a few harrowing swings in the stock markets and an implosion in the market for subprime mortgages, creating concern on Wall Street that corporate and financial buyers would pull back.There was special concern that a crisis in the credit markets would render deal making more difficult for private equity firms, which usually borrow heavily to pay for their acquisitions.But rather than retreat, buyout firms have taken their deals and fund-raising to new levels.In February, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Texas Pacific Group led a group of investors that offered to acquire TXU, the Texas energy giant, in a deal valued at $45 billion, including assumed debt. That would be the largest buyout ever, eclipsing last month’s $39 billion acquisition of Equity Office Properties Trust.“There are no signs that commercial credit is tightening up,” Mr. Filek of PricewaterhouseCoopers said. He also suggested that recent declines in the stock market might have spurred deal activity by lowering the prices of takeover targets.Private equity buyers, which accounted for a fifth of all deals last year, have made the biggest ones so far this year, but blockbuster transactions between public companies may also be on the way.ABN Amro of the Netherlands and Barclays of Britain recently disclosed that they are in discussions to merge, a deal that analysts estimate could value ABN as high as $88 billion. If an agreement is reached, it could surpass the 1998 merger of Travelers and Citicorp as the largest financial services deal in history.Buyout firms, meanwhile, continue to outdo each other with new, record-breaking funds. Both the Blackstone Group and the private equity unit of Goldman Sachs are raising funds that could reach $20 billion or more, providing plenty of fuel for taking companies private."
33,"The day of reckoning is near for millions of homeowners who financed their dream house by taking out an adjustable-rate mortgage.Rates are resetting higher, and in some cases, the monthly mortgage payments that were so affordable in 2004 or 2005 when the loan was signed will push homeowners to their limit or beyond.What is a borrower to do? You can try to make ends meet by cutting back on expenses. Shut off HBO and the premium cable channels, skip your Starbucks run and bring your lunch to work rather than eating out and you might have enough to cover the bump-up in your mortgage payment.Don’t despair. There is another way to look at this problem. You, the borrower, are not powerless. “Consumers get the feeling it is a lost cause to do anything, but it is pretty much the opposite,” said Harry H. Dinham, president of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. “The most motivated people are the lenders.”Homeowners should seek a lower rate or switch to an interest-only loan for a spell. They might even ask for more time to pay, just as long as it does not create “negative amortization,” that is, letting the amount owed increase with each payment.Mr. Dinham has been through six real estate cycles since 1967 and every time the market goes sour, he said, consumers make the mistake of avoiding the loan officer.But know this: lenders do not want to get stuck with a property. They have to maintain it and then try to sell it on the open market, usually at a loss. Some industry analysts say that it costs a bank an average of $40,000 to foreclose on a loan. That amount gives the borrower that much more room to negotiate.About 1.1 million homeowners will lose their homes to foreclosure because of a mortgage resetting to a higher rate over the next six to seven years, said Christopher L. Cagan, director for research and analytics at First American CoreLogic, a mortgage industry research firm in Santa Ana, Calif.He studied two databases with information on 58 million mortgages and sees a wave of mortgage resets moving through the system, first the mortgages with low teaser rates, followed by subprime loans and finally, as the decade comes to a close, the loans to homeowners with good credit.This pig-through-the-python transition is not enough to hurt the overall economy — about $112 billion will be lost, he calculated — but it is a world of pain for the households involved.Almost all of the teaser loans issued this decade — those mortgages offered for less than 3 percent — have reset in the last two years. Rates for most of the homeowners with good credit who obtained adjustable-rate mortgages during the boom years of the housing market will reset from 2008 to 2010. Mr. Cagan said he thought only 7 percent of these loans would default because of the reset.He concluded that “2008 is the pinch year.” If he were a gambling man — or a real estate investor, but really, what’s the difference? — he said he would start buying residential properties in 2009.The bulk of the subprime adjustable-rate mortgages, those made to people with less-than-sterling credit reports, are resetting this year and next. About 12 percent of the subprime mortgages will default, he predicted.Subprime borrowers are particularly vulnerable to resets because the interest rates they were originally paying were higher than market rates. People who were subprime borrowers are, by definition, those who have had trouble with money. Some were already on the edge when they borrowed. For instance, an adjustment on a $300,000 loan to 9.5 percent from 7 percent leads to a 26 percent increase in the payment, to $2,523 from $1,996.The way to look at resets, whether they are subprime or prime, is what percentage of income is going to the mortgage. Assume that the lender determined when it granted the loan that the borrower was paying 30 percent of income to mortgage payments. Using the example above, upon reset, the borrower is paying 7.8 percent more of their income to the mortgage, that is 30 percent times 26 percent.It becomes scarier when a borrower originally devoted 50 percent of income to mortgage payments, a rate not uncommon on the coasts where housing is more expensive. Multiply 50 percent times 26 percent and you reach the sad fact that the person has to pay 13 percent more of income to cover the mortgage. “At 50 percent of your income there is not that much you can cut,” Mr. Cagan said.Catherine Williams, the vice president for financial literacy at Consumer Credit Counseling Services in Houston, said, “We can all have a great garage sale, but, sadly, that only works once.”The smart thing to do is to take action before the lender does. The homeowner should initiate the contact with the lender. So first thing: know when your loan resets are scheduled and by how much and how often. Read those loan documents you got at closing.Then 90 to 120 days before the loan resets start talking to the lender. Lenders usually approach their borrowers 45 days before a reset. That is not enough time for a borrower to act. Here is anonline calculatorso you don’t even have to bother to count the days by hand: www.timeanddate.com/date/dateadd.html.If you started out with a 5.5 percent interest rate, it will adjust to something like 7.75 percent. “If you want to wait and get that rate you can,” said Joe Rogers, executive vice president for the sales and service systems office of Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “Or you could get a 6 percent fixed loan now.”The dynamics are slightly different when you have no equity in your home or the value of your home is less than the amount of your loan. As a negotiating ploy, you could suggest to your lender that you are willing to just walk away and rationalize the mortgage payments you made as monthly rent payments: tax-deductible monthly rent payments. You wouldn’t want to go through with it because you will seriously damage your credit. It’s a black mark that remains for seven years. Of course, by then the real estate cycle could be back to where it was in 2004 and lenders will be once again throwing loans to anyone.But tell your lender that’s what you intend to do. What you are seeking is what’s called a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Hearing that, the lender may find more motivation to work something out.Another strategy to suggest to the lender is something that is called a temporary buy down, Mr. Rogers said. The lender locks you into a rate that is slightly higher than the going rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage. Right now that would be 6 7/8 percent. In the first year of the loan, the payments are set as if you are paying a loan at 4 7/8 percent. In the second year it jumps to 5 7/8 percent. In the third and successive years it is 6 7/8.You would want this only in a circumstance where you are buying time and expect something to happen within three years that will bail you out. Not that you hope or pray something will happen in that time, but that you actually know you will get a big bonus, an inheritance, or a transfer so you can sell the house.If your rate does not reset until 2009 or 2010, just sit tight. A lot can change in two or three years. If you don’t believe that, look at how the housing market has changed from 2005.If there are more signs that the Federal Reserve will begin to lower interest rates, as you near a reset it might be worth considering riding an adjustable-rate mortgage down. A fixed rate is viewed as less risky. The spread between the opening rates on A.R.M.’s and those on fixed-rate loans are not very wide. Mr. Rogers said of taking an A.R.M., “that’s just rolling the dice; if the rates fall, just refinance again.”But if you worry that you might not be able to refinance as rates drop because a recession might decrease the equity in the home, the adjustable-rate mortgage will allow you to benefit from the lower rates. Erik Hurst, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business, said homeowners who took out A.R.M.’s benefited from lower-than-market rates. “If the Fed cuts rates, they’ve won again,” he said.Is there any good news in this topic? Mr. Cagan, the researcher at First American CoreLogic, found that if house prices went up 1 percent nationally, 70,000 fewer loans would foreclose because of resets.Of course, the opposite is true as well, he said. Every 1 percent fall in national prices drives an additional 70,000 loans into foreclosure. And for right now, at least, house prices are falling.FOLLOW-UP:Fidelity Investments said this week that it had calculated the amount of money an American retiring at age 65 would need just for health care during their twilight years: $215,000It was supposed to be a scary number to encourage Americans to save more, but spread over the 20-year life expectancy that Fidelity also predicts, that comes to $10,750 a year. Fidelity said 27 percent of the average Social Security check would cover that expense.The frightening part was another calculation. With the rate of health costs rising at more than twice the pace of general inflation, Fidelity said in 20 years, half of the Social Security check would be needed to cover health care costs."
34,"HELLO, everybody, and welcome back to the humor column of the Mutual Funds Report, where we wrestle chuckles out of the world of investing and finance. This time, we’re taking on the impending financial apocalypse prompted by the collapsing subprime mortgage market.You’re laughing already! Or maybe not. We at the column love a challenge.Surely you are familiar with this whole apocalypse notion, which registers way past mere “corrections” and “bursting bubbles” on the financial Bad-O-Meter. Apocalypse means things like fire and brimstone, dogs lying down with cats, and, of course, the Beast (who currently offers an A.P.R. of 6.66 percent).Is the end really nigh? Probably not. But the Four Horsemen of this particular apocalypse are plenty scary, as described in the news coverage of the mortgage market: the first is rising mortgage interest rates, followed by default by risky borrowers. Then comes failure of at least some of the lenders. And, if the crisis keeps escalating, you could end up with the collapse of all stocks linked to the housing and financial markets — which is, let’s face it, a huge chunk of the overall stock market. This would not be pretty.So here we are with the fret du jour, and wondering how we got into such a mess — just as we wondered about the excesses that led to the housing market bubble, the tech stock bubble and, back in the ’80s, the savings-and-loan bubble. You might get the feeling that we, as a culture, move from excess to excess, with somebody always willing to push the market a little further and consumers always willing to come along for the ride. And you would not be wrong.In the world of mortgages, that excess is exemplified by the wacky financial structures that companies came up with to get people into homes, like so-called liar loans, which require little or no documentation. Theindustrycalls them that. The companies sound as wild-and-crazy-guy-ish as some credit card hawkers whose standards have been about as low as a drunk’s at closing time.That is where Hellfire Schwartz comes in. Some years ago, we bought a computer game called Hellfire for my older son. Some weeks after buying the game, we started getting junk mail for a Hellfire Schwartz. I assume that we filled out the online registration form incorrectly, but who knows how a bug enters the system?All I know is that for years now, Hellfire Schwartz has gotten come-ons from credit card companies that are so desperate for new customers that they are willing to extend credit to a glitch. And when we moved to another state, the Hellfire mail followed us.As a family, we try not to carry a lot of plastic. (After our longtime credit card company jacked up our annual interest rate to 29 percent over a late payment, we limited ourselves to a debit card and one revolving card from our credit union.) But my wife, who works as a checker at a department store, sees the rest of America come through on a daily basis, pulling out wallets bulging with 15 or more cards and, embarrassingly, having more than one of them turn up over their credit limits. Why do we let ourselves sail out so far over the line? And who keeps moving the line out further?I make no argument for abdicating personal responsibility, but I do wonder what kind of company thinks that a guy named Hellfire Schwartz looks like a good credit risk. They love Hellfire.Which brings us back to the apocalypse. Things look pretty grim at the moment, and it doesn’t take a Nostradamus to predict pain ahead. The excesses will be curbed, and financial opportunities will be lost. (Google “baby” and “bathwater.”) The Democrats will call for tighter regulation of industry, while the Republicans will call for greater protections for companies against the excesses of irresponsible consumers.And then, after the shouting, we will be left to muddle through, perhaps to hum along with the Alan Greenspans of bluegrass, the Austin Lounge Lizards, whose analysis of the current situation is incisive:Though we hear reassurances that everything is fineIt’s been a while since we’ve heard a canary in this mineIt’s when we think it’s really bad it gets a little worseBut keep on looking forward though we’re going in reverseWe’ve been through tough times before. We pick up, we move on. The wild and crazy guys do, too. And, somewhere out there, the next bubble is already forming."
35,"Some of the problems afflicting mortgages sold to borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit increasingly appear to be cropping up in loans made to homeowners who were thought to be less risky.The latest sign of possible further deterioration in the credit market came yesterday as American Home Mortgage, a lender based in Melville, N.Y., said that it would earn less and pay out a smaller dividend because it was being asked to buy back and write down the value of certain loans.Those loans are known as Alternative A, or Alt-A, and were made to borrowers with decent credit. Shares in the company tumbled 15.2 percent, to close at $21.92.The announcement followed a disclosure last week by M&T Bank, a regional bank based in Buffalo, that it would write down Alt-A loans and no longer sell them because bids for the mortgages came in lower than it had expected.Since the subprime mortgage market began deteriorating late last year, investors and analysts have kept a close watch on Alt-A loans, worrying that problems in higher-grade loans would prove to be a greater threat to the housing market and the economy.Alt-A loans are made to borrowers with credit ratings that fall between prime and subprime, or to homeowners who have prime credit but are seeking a somewhat riskier loan.Such loans made up about 10 percent of all mortgages outstanding at the end of 2006 and made up about 18 percent of home loans written last year, according to Moody’s Economy.com.Together, subprime and Alt-A loans account for about 21 percent of loans outstanding and 39 percent of mortgages made in 2006.The delinquency rate for Alt-A mortgages remains much lower than the rate for subprime mortgages, but it has been rising. In February, 2.6 percent of Alt-A loans were delinquent by 60 or more days, up from 1.22 percent a year before, according to FirstAmerican LoanPerformance. By comparison, 12.44 percent of subprime loans were delinquent by more than two months, up from 7.84 percent.Reports that Wall Street, which made millions of dollars securitizing mortgages in recent years, is becoming more wary of Alt-A by putting loans back to lenders or by bidding less for them could be an indication that default rates will worsen before they improve.The problems in subprime mortgages started late last year when big investment banks started returning delinquent loans to lenders. Many of those lenders have since filed for bankruptcy protection.“The credit markets were showering the mortgage market with capital, and now that’s just evaporating,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. “The capital markets are going to exacerbate the problem, seemingly.”Until recently, mortgage companies had been able to sell loans to Wall Street banks and other investors for a premium that was big enough to cover their costs of making the loans and to make a tidy profit. The banks would then package the loans into pools to be sold as bonds to hedge funds, insurance companies and other investors.“Now you are selling at par or lower in some instances,” said Thomas M. McCarthy, a managing director at Carlton Group, a real estate investment firm that brokers the sale of mortgages. “It really throws the business upside down.”For American Home Mortgage, the lower prices investors are willing to pay for Alt-A loans will mean that the company will earn from 40 cents to 60 cents a share in the first quarter. Analysts had expected it to earn $1.06 a share, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Beginning in the second quarter, the company, which is structured as a real estate investment trust, will reduce the dividend for its common shares to 70 cents a share, down from $1.12 in the first quarter. The company also said it would write down $484 million in mortgage securities it owns because of the lower prices at which the bonds were now trading.Until recently, Alt-A loans were considered by many investors to be only slightly more risky than prime mortgages, and losses in bonds backed by the mortgages were small and rare, said Zach Gast, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis.“This is a definite sign that at least in the secondary market the subprime issues are spilling over,” he said.Default rates have been worst for loans written in 2006, as many mortgage companies loosened lending standards by allowing more borrowers to make no down payments and not verifying that borrowers indeed earned what they claimed they did in mortgage applications. The companies relaxed the rules in an effort to bolster business at a time when interest rates were rising and the housing boom was fading.Alt-A loans are also vulnerable to the deterioration in formerly hot housing markets along the coasts and in the Southwest, because they were often used by investors who were buying properties with the intention of quickly reselling them at a profit.“Alt-A seems to be located regionally in spots where the market is having a great deal of difficulty, particularly in Las Vegas, Arizona and Florida,” Mr. Zandi said. So far, however, the problems in the housing and mortgage businesses appear to have had only a modest overall impact on the broader economy.Still, Mr. Zandi says the true test will come in the next two to three months during the peak of the spring home selling season. He notes that employment in the construction sector, which had grown at a rapid pace during the housing boom, has leveled off in recent months but has not fallen significantly even as construction spending has tumbled."

Analysts had expected it to earn $1.06 a share, according to a survey by Bloomberg News.Beginning in the second quarter, the company, which is structured as a real estate investment trust, will reduce the dividend for its common shares to 70 cents a share, down from $1.12 in the first quarter. The company also said it would write down $484 million in mortgage securities it owns because of the lower prices at which the bonds were now trading.Until recently, Alt-A loans were considered by many investors to be only slightly more risky than prime mortgages and losses in bonds backed by the mortgages were small and rare, said Zach Gast, an analyst at the Center for Financial Research and Analysis.""This is a definite sign that, at least in the secondary market, the subprime issues are spilling over,"" he said."
37,"The problems in the subprime loan market will make it more difficult for borrowers to get mortgages and will cause home prices to fall this year for the first time on record, the National Association of Realtors said yesterday.The 2007 median price for an existing home probably will decline 0.7 percent, to $220,300, the first drop since the real estate trade group began keeping records in 1968 and probably the first decline since the Great Depression, said Lawrence Yun, an economist with the association, which is based in Chicago. The median price for new homes is projected to increase 0.4 percent, to $246,200 this year, the smallest gain since prices fell in 1991.Home purchases are being derailed as subprime lenders stop financing mortgages or go out of business, increasing inventory and weakening demand, Mr. Yun said. In the last 12 months, at least 40 subprime lenders have halted operations, gone out of business, or sought buyers as borrower defaults increased. On April 2, New Century Financial, the largest independent subprime lender, filed for bankruptcy protection.Subprime loans are made to borrowers with a history of missed payments, untested credit or heavy debt. Lenders to them charge higher interests rates than conventional mortgage companies because borrowers are more likely to default.“We’ve been getting reports from Realtors out in the field about home closings not going through at the last minute because of loan problems,” Mr. Yun said in an interview. “That impacts all homeowners because it affects prices.”New-home sales will probably decline 16 percent this year, to 904,000, while sales of existing homes are likely to fall 2 percent, to 6.34 million, from 6.48 million last year, the association said.Mortgage rates probably will not increase, according to the report. The 2007 average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage will match the 6.4 percent in 2006, and the average for a 30-year annually adjusting mortgage probably will stay at last year’s 5.5 percent, the forecast said."
38,"WASHINGTON —Amid new signs that the housing slump is worsening, Senate Democrats are saying that hundreds of millions of dollars of new federal aid may be needed to assist homeowners at risk of foreclosure.The call Wednesday for federal involvement from Charles Shumer, a Democrat from New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, came on the same day the National Association of Realtors issued a forecast that the median price for existing homes would decline for the first time since 1968 as a sales slump worsens.""We will be proposing significant amounts of dollars,"" Schumer told reporters after being asked if a large federal bailout might be needed.""We've heard one heartbreaking story after another of borrowers with limited incomes being sold mortgages they could not afford,"" Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said at a briefing on Capitol Hill.His words were backed up by the real estate group's prediction of a 0.7 percent decline to $220,300 this year in the median sale price for existing homes, down from $221,900 last year. Tighter lending standards and the continued fallout from the troubled market for loans given to people with shaky credit are to blame, the group said.Across town, a nonprofit advocacy group from Boston, the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, called on Wall Street to help homeowners restructure their mortgage loans.The NAR also revised downward its estimate of total sales this year of existing homes to a decline of 2.2 percent, compared to an earlier forecast of a 0.9 percent decline. New home sales are expected to fall 14.2 percent compared to a previous estimate of a 10.4 percent slide, the NAR said.Edward Leamer, an economist and the director of Anderson Forecast at the University of California, Los Angeles, says that estimate is too conservative.He projects a decline in the price of existing homes of between 2 percent and 3 percent this year and expects that trend to continue for two to three more years.With high-interest rate mortgages for people with poor credit no longer available, Leamer said, ""you're eliminating 20 to 30 percent of the demand for homes.""Senator Christopher Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, said that he would call for a summit on Capitol Hill soon ""to try to work out a process for providing relief to homeowners.""With 1.8 million adjustable rate mortgages resetting to higher rates this year and next, foreclosures are sure to continue rising, the 32-page report from the Joint Economic Committee said. Areas hardest hit by foreclosures include Atlanta, Indianapolis, Denver, Dallas and Detroit, the report said.In Detroit, one of every 21 mortgages was foreclosed last year, according to the JEC, which used RealtyTrac's foreclosure database.The Federal Housing Administration could be revamped to refinance mortgages in danger of default, the JEC's report said, citing a proposal by a Harvard professor under which the housing agency could oversee a ""rescue fund"" that would restructure failed or failing mortgages. Aid could also be provided to community organizations or banks that work with borrowers to refinance loans.""We'd like to do something very quickly,"" Schumer said.""These statistics are new and they're startling.""Lawmakers also are considering strengthening federal regulation of mortgages, imposing a stricter ban on predatory lending practices and requiring lenders to establish a borrower's ability to pay back a mortgage loan through the life of the loan, not just for two or three years. Adovcacy and community groups are stepping up efforts to aid homeowners affected by the housing market's woes. They argue that banks and mortgage brokers, not borrowers, bear most of the blame for the industry's problems. Rising delinquencies and defaults among borrowers have resulted in more than two dozen so-called subprime lenders going out of business, moving into bankruptcy protection or putting themselves up for sale. Last week, civil rights groups called for a six-month moratorium on foreclosures resulting from high-risk loans given to people with shaky credit, arguing that lenders could face lawsuits if they do not help borrowers. The mortgage industry says that lenders are already working to help distressed borrowers. The Boston-based Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America announced plans Wednesday in Washington to work with Bank of America and Citigroup on refinancing troubled loans.NACA said that existing funds from those banks pledged through federal regulations requiring loans for low- to moderate-income home buyers could be used to help 7,000 to 10,000 homeowners with high-interest-rate mortgages refinance at lower rates. ""We want to send out hope to the victims of the subprime lending crisis,"" said Bruce Marks, NACA's chief executive. ""There is hope if you are about to lose your house."" Citibank in 2003 pledged $3 billion worth of financing over 10 years to NACA for affordable housing, said Mark Rodgers, a Citibank spokesman, adding that the bank had similar agreements with other community groups. Greg Barnard, a spokesman for Bank of America, said that the NACA plan would use previously committed funds from the bank. Marks said the group aims to convince other big lenders and Wall Street investors to help consumers avoid foreclosures and obtain loans that they can afford. ""The real question is how big"" the housing market's drop is going to be, Leamer said."

40,"WASHINGTON —The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday limited states' power to oversee financial institutions, ruling that Michigan could not regulate mortgage-lending subsidiaries of Wachovia and other federally chartered banks.The number of national bank subsidiaries has grown to about 500, and they engage in mortgage lending and a wide range of other activities.Writing for the majority, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said, ""We have treated operating subsidiaries as equivalent to national banks."" In a dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said the court's decision ""threatens the vitality of most state laws as applied to national banks.""The ruling came at a time of rising calls for tighter regulation of the mortgage business because of the subprime lending crisis. In March, federal bank regulators proposed new guidelines for subprime lending, including clearer explanations of loan terms and ensuring that borrowers can afford their monthly payments for the life of the loan, not just a low-rate introductory period.Wachovia, the bank involved in the court case, took advantage of a rule adopted by the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in 2002. It enabled the comptroller to push states out of the regulatory picture regarding subsidiaries of national banks.Many states say the reality is that when state regulators are pushed aside, federal regulators are not filling the gap. That, state officials say, is because there often are no federal laws comparable to the ones that state regulators enforce. In addition, the states say, federal regulators do not have the resources to deal with the flood of consumer complaints that the states handle each year.The primary function of the federal comptroller is to scrutinize books of national banks to ascertain whether the institutions are financially sound. The comptroller's office says that it has ample resources and legal tools to respond promptly to consumer complaints and that it moves aggressively to provide protection to consumers. Consumer advocates argued that states were better equipped to protect against predatory lending and other potential abuses because they were more familiar with and accountable to their constituencies.The case began in 2003 when Wachovia Mortgage became an operating subsidiary of Wachovia Bank. After the mortgage lender said it would comply only with federal regulations, state officials banned it from operating in Michigan, prompting Wachovia to sue. The Sixth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, based in Cincinnati, sided with Wachovia, saying the subsidiary was not subject to state regulations. The Supreme Court upheld that ruling."

42,"HAVE you noticed how quickly financial market crises come and go nowadays? Refco, the venerable commodities firm, disintegrated in a week in 2005 and last year’s demise of Amaranth, a $6 billion hedge fund, took about the same amount of time. It is a measure of how deep and wide the money pools are today that the billions lost at these institutions amounted to no more than a blip on a screen.The mortgage mess, however, has a different look and feel. As much as investors, lenders and home sellers want it to be over, it is likely to drag on.There are several reasons for this. Working out troubled loans one by one takes time. So does selling tracts of empty homes.But there is also this: Because of the way mortgages are packaged into pools and sold to investors, it is still not clear who owns the faltering loans and how much money has been lost.This episode seems to be unfolding in slow motion.Certainly, the bad news keeps coming. Last week, we learned that foreclosure rates soared 47 percent in March over the same period in 2006.RealtyTrac, a keeper of a database of properties in foreclosure or about to be, reported that California had 31,434 foreclosures in March, nearly triple the figure from the same period last year. Foreclosure rates in Nevada and Colorado also surged.Fears are rising among builders as well. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Home Price Index, a measure of builder confidence, fell to 33 in April. Last year at this time, the index stood at 51.“The tightening of mortgage lending standards in connection with the subprime crisis has shaken the confidence of both consumers and builders,” said David F. Seiders, the chief economist at the home builders association.Mr. Seiders did not mention investors, but they can’t be happy, either. A report from asset-backed-securities analysts at Lehman Brothers last week estimated that some $19 billion in losses are sitting in loan pools assembled in 2005, 2006 and early 2007. Most of these losses are in collateralized debt obligations, securities that invested aggressively in mortgages in recent years and that pension funds, insurance companies and hedge funds all hold.Lehman estimates losses of $1.5 billion on 2005 issues, $11.4 billion on those from 2006 and an additional $5.9 billion from the 2007 vintage, including those still in the pipeline. Sound like a lot of money? It is: the $18.8 billion accounts for about 5.5 percent of all mortgages issued and outstanding in the period.These figures are estimates, not actual losses, because accounting rules allow pension funds and insurance companies that hold these securities to mark their stakes at the prices they paid for them, not at the current market levels. The losses are there, but they remain unrecorded.Only when these investors sell their holdings do they have to book the loss they incur. That’s no fun, so investors are likely to hang on to their holdings as long as they can. If they need liquidity, they could be pushed to sell, of course. Another thing that could force sales: a downgrade by Moody’s, Standard & Poor’s or Fitch Ratings, the credit rating agencies. Most pension funds and insurance companies cannot hold securities that are rated below investment grade — “junk” in industry parlance.This has not yet happened, to the immense relief of investors, no doubt. Notwithstanding all the news about defaults, delinquencies and foreclosures, the rating agencies have not downgraded many mortgage loans because, they say, they do not expect their original assumptions regarding the loans’ performance to change substantially.As Susan Barnes, a managing director at S.& P., told Congress last week, the firm had downgraded just 0.3 percent of the subprime issues it rated, as of April 12. “While we do not expect there to be widespread downgrades,” she explained, “if the marketplace or economy as a whole experiences further financial distress, there could be a more prolonged period of negative performance, and S.& P. may need to take further rating actions.”WHILE investors have not had to face harsh market realities, homeowners looking to refinance their loans will not be as fortunate as lenders tighten their underwriting standards and home prices soften, according to Lehman. Lehman says it expects that 20 percent to 30 percent of borrowers who took out loans last year will be unable to refinance their mortgages when the terms of their loans reset. The firm said that it expects as many as 15 percent of borrowers who struck deals in 2005 to be shut out of the mortgage market when they try to refinance.If true, this will increase defaults on these loans significantly. Lehman estimates cumulative losses of 11.4 percent on 2006 loans and almost 13 percent on 2007 loans.These estimates may prove high, Lehman said, if mortgage lenders and servicers offer generous loan modifications to struggling borrowers.And last week, investors were heartened by Freddie Mac’s announcement that this summer it would begin offering $20 billion in loans to borrowers trying to refinance their mortgages. Fannie Mae, another big mortgage lender, has also agreed to put money into a refinancing pot.That’s great for borrowers, but not for investors in existing mortgage pools, said Thomas A. Lawler, founder of Lawler Economic and Housing Consulting. He noted last week that these initiatives would attract the better borrowers, those who could meet more stringent lending requirements, such as being able to muster a 20 percent down payment and document appropriate income levels.But as these people pay off their existing loans, two problems arise for investors. The prepayment of the loan means expected income from it disappears, and it also leaves mortgage pool investors with a greater proportion of troubled borrowers.“To the extent that the availability of these programs makes it possible for better subprime borrowers to refinance away from current lenders and into a better mortgage product,” Mr. Lawler said, “it’s hard to see how that will be beneficial to the existing holders of subordinated subprime loans.”Fannie and Freddie, in other words, are not putting out the welcome mat for mortgage loans that should never have been made. Those remain squarely in the hands of investors. We may not know who they are. But they do."
43,"AGOURA HILLS, Calif.  Visitors to Ownit Mortgage Solutions’ offices here are met by an abandoned reception desk and three dying potted plants that appear to have gone months without water.How appropriate.Ownit filed for bankruptcy protection late last year; since then, several companies that specialized in loans to people with weak, or subprime, credit have followed it into bankruptcy as the once-thriving business has withered on the vine. Gone are the lavish parties, the extravagant trips and the executive salaries and sales commissions that routinely topped a million dollars.Lenders like New Century Financial and Ownit, many of them based in Southern California, have cut an estimated 12,000 mortgage jobs in California since the start of 2006, according to MortgageDaily.com, a trade publication. Nationally, 16,000 jobs have been lost.What used to be a profitable partnership between subprime lenders and Wall Street banks has now degenerated into a cross-country blame game.Lenders in California say big investment banks encouraged and pushed them to make risky loans. On Wall Street, bank executives say mortgage lenders became sloppy and did not pay enough attention to fraud. Whatever the cause, Ownit provides a vivid example of what went wrong.William D. Dallas, the founder and chief executive of Ownit, acknowledges loosening lending standards but says he did so reluctantly and under pressure from his investors, particularly Merrill Lynch, which wanted more loans to package into lucrative securities.He recalls being asked to make more “stated income” loans, in which lenders do not verify the information provided by borrowers and brokers with tax returns, pay stubs or other documentation. The message, he said, was simple: You are leaving money on the table  do more of them.Mr. Dallas, a trim 51-year-old who has been in the mortgage business for more than 25 years, said he disagreed, but complied.“If I can sell it at a profit,” he said, “why would I not do it?”A spokesman for Merrill Lynch denied Mr. Dallas’s assertions, but declined to elaborate.Mortgage companies like Ownit grew quickly last year by making it easier for home buyers to take out loans without proving their incomes or making down payments.In retrospect, it was exactly the wrong time to ease credit: interest rates were rising and home prices were cresting after a sharp four-year rally. Many in the industry also suspected that speculation and fraud were rampant in many hot real estate markets on the coasts and in the Southwest.There is no doubt that the standards in the subprime market deteriorated sharply last year. More than 44 percent of all subprime loans in 2006 were based on limited documents or none at all, up from 38 percent in 2004, according to Lehman Brothers. More than 26 percent of borrowers took out a second mortgage, indicating that they did not have enough savings for a full down payment, up from 14 percent.But Tom Marano, who heads the mortgage business at Bear Stearns, disputed the contention that Wall Street pressure led to the loosening of credit standards. Investment banks, he said, do not directly make many loans.“If enough independent companies set standards, that becomes the market,” he said. “Wall Street’s role is largely one where we assess risk, we purchase loans.”Wall Street, however, is now wading more directly and deeply into the business. Big banks and hedge funds are buying up bankrupt or ailing mortgage companies that did not have enough capital to weather the downturn. These bigger financial players and more diversified lenders like Countrywide Financial may well inherit the subprime business.And many companies like Ownit are simply fading away.Last year, Ownit made $9.5 billion in loans, up 15 percent from 2005. Slightly fewer than a quarter of the loans it made in 2005 and 2006, according to data from Moody’s Investors Service, had limited documentation  better than the industry average  but lending to borrowers with lower credit scores increased sharply over that period.The popularity of stated-income loans, derisively referred to as “liar’s loans” by critics, seemed impervious to evidence that the loans made it easier for borrowers and brokers to commit fraud.According to a report by the Mortgage Asset Research Institute, for example, one lender found in a sampling of loan applications that the incomes listed on 60 percent of the applications were, on average, 50 percent higher than those on the borrowers’ tax returns.Lenders liked the loans because they could be processed quickly. Loan officers did not have to verify bank statements, tax returns or other documents.Borrowers also were charged a higher interest rate, often about 0.5 percentage point higher, making the loans more profitable.“Lenders didn’t highlight to the borrower that they could save a little bit of money had they provided full documentation,” said Mark H. Adelson, an analyst with Nomura Securities in New York. “Why not get the borrower to pay a little more interest?”Officials at mortgage companies and Wall Street banks acknowledge that it may be too dangerous to allow borrowers with weak credit who are financing 100 percent of a home’s purchase price to borrow without documentation of their income. But they defend the practice as appropriate for buyers with better credit or those making a substantial down payment, arguing that it helps extend homeownership.The loans are, proponents say, primarily used by borrowers who are self-employed or who earn money through off-the-books second jobs or child support payments. The practice also helps those relying on incomes of companions or roommates who are not listed on mortgage applications because they have a tarnished credit history.“The lower-income population doesn’t always have the traditional documentation that the middle-class borrower typically has,” said Mr. Marano of Bear Stearns. “There has been an effort to, frankly, satisfy some of the needs in the housing market by expanding the guidelines.”That desire to expand homeownership fed Mr. Dallas’s own entrepreneurial fire.“I am passionate about the normal person owning a home,” said Mr. Dallas, who is also chairman of the Fox Sports Grill restaurant chain and manages the business interests of the Olsen twins. “I think owning a home solves all their problems.”As he discusses homeownership, Mr. Dallas becomes animated and his voice rises. He fetches copies of a booklet, “Strategic Financing: A Survival Guide for Loan Originators,” he helped write for loan officers and brokers, and points to charts and tables to help explain his thinking. His speaking style seems part revival preacher and part courtroom lawyer.Mr. Dallas created Ownit from a small mortgage company he and his partners bought in 2003 for $30 million. Two years earlier, he had left First Franklin, a lender he co-founded in 1981 and which was then owned by National City. (Merrill Lynch bought First Franklin last year for $1.3 billion.)Ownit was different from other subprime lenders. About 70 percent of the company’s loans were made for the purchase of homes, while about 60 percent of all subprime loans were used to refinance existing debts.Mr. Dallas, a native of Ohio who moved to California as a young adult, said he created Ownit to serve borrowers who earned less than $100,000 and had less than $100,000 in assets, a group he calls the “mass nonaffluents.”The company was a big lender of 40-year and 45-year mortgages, which Mr. Dallas says are a better way to put moderate- and low-income families into homes than adjustable-rate loans that start with low introductory rates but reset after a few years to much higher rates.His passion proved compelling. In 2005, Merrill Lynch bought a 20 percent stake in Ownit, whose majority owner was CIVC Partners, a private equity firm in Chicago.Merrill, along with JPMorgan Chase, also provided Ownit with billions of dollars in credit lines to make mortgages.But Mr. Dallas’s relationship with Merrill began to sour in 2006 after the bank announced in September that it was buying First Franklin and as defaults on loans Ownit made that year spiked.Merrill argued that Ownit was contractually obligated to buy back loans made to borrowers who had missed the first few payments. Mr. Dallas asserted his company would not do so because the borrowers made their payments to Ownit before the loans were sold. He further argued that Ownit was not responsible for missed payments after Merrill bought the loans.The disagreements reached a crisis in early December, when the company’s credit lines were expiring. Merrill and Ownit’s other backers decided against continuing to finance the company, which was losing money.The squabbling has continued into bankruptcy court. Creditors are opposing a compensation package of as much as $300,000 for Mr. Dallas, arguing that he is not doing much to earn the pay, which would be used to reduce the $1.8 million he owes the company, according to bankruptcy court filings.When the company’s 800 employees were laid off in December, few had an inkling about its troubles. Many left so quickly that they left behind family pictures, toothbrushes and other personal items.“We were in disbelief and shock,” said Lisa Tait, an operations manager with 26 years of experience in the business. She said the collapse was different from past downturns because this time there were no warning signs. “A group of us had become very close. Some people were upset; some people were angry.”Thankfully, she said, most of her colleagues have found other jobs in the healthy Southern California economy. Ms. Tait, 43, returned to Ownit earlier this year to help it through bankruptcy proceedings.Hallways at the office are lined with boxes filled with loan documents that are waiting to be sorted and sent on to the investors who bought the mortgages. One corner of the former cafeteria is taken up by boxes marked “DEAD,” containing files for loans that were never finished.Executives are negotiating with regulators on what should be done with all the files, which they are legally required to preserve.“This is what a bankrupt subprime company looks like,” Mr. Dallas said. “No employees, and lots of files.”"
44,"Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, helped soothe concerns that problems in the subprime mortgage market would spread, saying today that the Fed sees “no serious broader spillover.”And he appeared skeptical of tighter regulation of mortgage lenders by the central bank or by Congress.In a speech at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, Mr. Bernanke gave his first extended remarks on the subprime mortgage troubles, which have implications beyond homeowners with weak, or subprime, credit histories.As more and more subprime lenders have filed for bankruptcy in the face of rising homeowner defaults, credit is becoming harder to attain for many people. Some economists fear this belt-tightening by mortgage lenders could spread beyond the subprime market and harm consumer spending.Though the Fed expects foreclosures and delinquencies to continue rising, Mr. Bernanke said he thought the damage has so far been limited and was likely to stay that way. “The vast majority of mortgages, including even subprime mortgages, continue to perform well,” he said. “Past gains in house prices have left most homeowners with significant amounts of home equity, and growth in jobs and incomes should help keep the financial obligations of most households manageable.”As the housing market exploded, one of the effects was the widespread availability of mortgages. Lenders relaxed their standards and gave mortgages  at higher rates  to people with incomes and credit that would have ordinarily disqualified them from receiving a loan.Defaults among subprime borrowers have been rising, leaving the institutions that gave credit out so freely in jeopardy. In Washington, there have been calls from top Democrats to more tightly regulate mortgage lenders.Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who heads the House-Senate Joint Economic Committee, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who heads the House Financial Services Committee, have each outlined plans that take aim at predatory lenders.But Mr. Bernanke broadly warned against tighter lending regulations, saying that they can have the unintended consequence of cutting off credit to too many people. “Rules are useful if they can be drawn sharply,” he said. “Sometimes, however, specific lending practices that may be viewed as inappropriate in some circumstances are appropriate in others.”He said the Fed’s primary role in preventing loan abuse was by making sure that lenders properly disclose all the conditions and risks associated with mortgages. Beyond that, he said, the Fed can offer guidance to financial institutions as they devise loan practices. But he was cautious about issuing any new rules.“We must be careful not to inadvertently suppress responsible lending or eliminate refinancing opportunities for subprime borrowers,” he said."
45,"ANYONE who believes that the worst is over in the subprime mortgage fiasco need merely wait awhile. A tsunami of interest rate increases on these loans is headed your way.Adjustable-rate mortgages, with interest rates that recalibrate according to market fluctuations, have been among the more questionable “innovations” sweeping through the staid world of home lending in recent years. Especially ingenious — for lenders, at least — were so-called exploding A.R.M.’s that lured borrowers with unusually low teaser rates that then reset skyward two or three years later (typically pegged to the London Interbank Offered Rate, plus six percentage points).During the next five years, some $1 trillion in adjustable-rate mortgages will reset. But in the here and now — from just June to October this year — more than $100 billion of that amount is scheduled to reset, and all of it is in loans that are in the riskier subprime category. Given the recent interest rate spike, many of those loans that once carried low teaser rates are on track to reset to at least 11 percent — or more than four percentage points higher than the current rate on a conventional, 30-year home loan.Chances are slim that even the most creditworthy borrowers can survive payment shocks like these. And so, as the reset storm hits, delinquencies will rise and foreclosures will follow. It is too early to estimate how many foreclosures will take place as a result, but last year there were 1.2 million, according to RealtyTrac, an online real estate database.In one index of mortgages that tracks 20 loan pools issued in the second half of 2005 — a subset of an index called the ABX — some 42 percent of those loans are about to hit the reset button on their interest rates. But we don’t have to wait for that to happen to know there’s trouble brewing: delinquencies in the ABX loan pools have already started ballooning. A Morgan Stanley analysis shows that 8 percent of mortgage loans in pools put together in the latter part of 2005 were more than 60 days delinquent in May. Even more worrisome, almost 4 percent of the loans made in the second half of 2006 were more than two months delinquent. That’s almost double the delinquency rate for loans made one year earlier and at the same point in their terms.What’s more, fully 35 percent of the most recently issued loan pools in the index have delinquency rates that exceed the target levels specified when they were sold to investors. And for loans made in the first half of 2006, three-quarters are exceeding their delinquency targets.ADD to this grim picture the fact that many of the loans taken out most recently are held by people who probably have little or no equity in their homes. As prices soften further, these borrowers will find themselves “upside down” — owing more on their mortgage than their houses are worth.None of this bodes well for home prices, which are already flat or falling. Then again, this is what a mania always looks like when it unravels.Elizabeth Warren, a Harvard Law School professor and bankruptcy expert, said that this ugly scenario is proof that consumers need protection from financial products that can wipe them out. She is calling for the creation of a Financial Product Safety Commission to oversee the increasingly complex market for loans and other financial goods. (For a more elaborate explanation, you can read her article in “Democracy: A Journal of Ideas” online at democracyjournal.org/article.php?ID=6544.)“We have basic safety regulations for nearly every product a consumer can buy, except the ones that ruin them financially,” Ms. Warren said in an interview. “We would not be where we are today with home mortgage foreclosures and millions of families in bankruptcy or on the brink of economic collapse if we had had better regulation of financial products.”A data point in support of her thesis: five years ago, Fannie Mae estimated that 50 percent of the borrowers who took out subprime mortgages had credit profiles that could have qualified them for prime rates. While that may not have been the case in the late stages of the mania, it suggests that some of the people who are facing enormous resets may be doing so unnecessarily.Many in the industry argue, of course, that borrowers, not lenders, are responsible for any problems they experience with their loans. If they didn’t want a loan that would reset to a sky-high level, why did they sign the documents?“If we had 1.2 million people whose toasters had exploded this year, we would not be saying they should have checked the wiring more closely before they bought those things,” Ms. Warren said. “We would say those are products that should not have been put on the market. I completely understand it makes no sense to try to insure that every product will be 100 percent safe. But consumers should not be faced with products that are so unsafe that they will cost them their homes.”Ms. Warren’s idea for a financial product consumer safety unit will probably be laughed off the stage by the anti-regulation crowd. Get ready for gripes and groans from the usual suspects saying that increased regulation would poison the American economy and cripple our competitiveness.“The anti-regulation folks say all regulation is bad, and yet we live in a world where regulation works most of the time,” she said. “We don’t eat tainted meat and we don’t drink adulterated milk because we have fairly good regulation. Financial products are no different. Free markets are not well supported when consumers are at risk for injury.”It would be nice if this notion got an airing on Capitol Hill on Wednesday, when Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, convenes hearings on the future of federal consumer protection in the financial industry. Makers of exploding toasters would surely be dragged to Congress to explain themselves; why shouldn’t the people who manufactured exploding mortgages be asked to do the same?Some states are taking the matter of protecting consumers into their own hands. Last week, Maine’s state Senate followed its House of Representatives in unanimously passing legislation that requires lenders there to evaluate a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage and recommend only loans that make sense for them. It would also prohibit lenders from charging financing points and fees in high-cost mortgages, a practice that allows lenders to both strip equity from homeowners and hide the true cost of the loan.THE law brings to mind the suitability requirements in federal securities regulations that protect investors. Stockbrokers are not allowed to peddle stocks and bonds to clients whose financial situation or risk tolerance make the investments inappropriate. Why shouldn’t mortgage bankers be subjected to a similar prohibition?Gov. John E. Baldacci is scheduled to sign the Maine Homeowner Protection Act tomorrow. Kaylene Waindle, special assistant to Glenn Cummings, Maine’s House speaker and lead sponsor of the bill, said: “While we hope that the federal government takes some action, to wait on somebody else to protect our citizens would be irresponsible. We also feel pretty strongly that this bill can serve as a blueprint for the federal government.”State regulators have shamed their federal counterparts into action before. Let’s see if they can do it again."
46,"ZURICH —Swiss banks, including UBS and Credit Suisse Group, could be hurt by a sudden deterioration in economic conditions triggered by the U.S. subprime lending slump, Switzerland's central bank said Thursday.""One cannot exclude that the events in the U.S. subprime mortgage markets at the beginning of 2007 could turn out to be early warning signs of a larger crisis to come in the U.S. property market or of a general decline in credit quality,"" the Swiss National Bank said.While banks including UBS and Credit Suisse, the two largest lenders in the country, have increased their ability to absorb shocks, recent increases in risk-taking and costs may have made the country's financial system vulnerable, the SNB said in a report on banking stability.""It is unclear whether the finance industry's capital buffer, in the form of equity capital, is adequate to weather particularly bad storms,"" an SNB governing board member, Philipp Hildebrand, said in a speech.Losses equivalent to 3 percent of the balance sheet of the big Swiss banks would be enough to erase that cushion, Hildebrand said. While unlikely, ""such a loss cannot be ruled out.""Making improvements to the way the two banks measure and report risks ""would help to reinforce the stability of the Swiss banking sector,"" the report also said.The national bank's report echoed a similar concern by the International Monetary Fund, which last week said UBS and Credit Suisse should be subject to tighter supervision and may need to put aside more capital to cover risks. from derivatives trading.The central bank also raised its three-month target rate Thursday to 2.5 percent, as expected, the highest level since September 2001. Switzerland's main rate is still the second lowest of the major currencies after Japan and the currency has declined as investors borrowed in the franc to fund investments in higher yielding assets."
47,"WASHINGTON, June 14 — Delinquencies and foreclosures among homeowners with weak credit moved higher in the first quarter, particularly in California, Florida and other formerly hot real estate markets, according to an industry report released on Thursday.The report, published by the Mortgage Bankers Association, came as the Federal Reserve held a hearing on what regulators could do to address aggressive abusive lending practices. Also Thursday, the latest survey showed that mortgage rates this week reached their highest level in almost a year; the national average for a 30-year mortgage was 6.74 percent, up from 6.53 percent last week, according to Freddie Mac, the mortgage giant.The delinquency report presented a mixed picture. It indicated that more homeowners with tarnished, or subprime, credit are likely to have trouble making house payments, especially as interest rates rise. But it also suggested that, at least so far, the problems have not extended very far into the larger pool of prime borrowers, whose interest rates are lower because of their stronger credit.At the end of March, the percentage of all loans that were delinquent or in foreclosure, 6.12 percent, was little changed from the end of last year and up from 5.39 percent from March 2006.The national numbers benefited from a decrease in the defaults among loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration. The agency and the lenders it works with have been restructuring two out of every three loans in foreclosure, said Douglas Duncan, chief economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association. And it appears similar efforts to renegotiate mortgages to keep borrowers in their homes may also be holding down defaults overall.“We are seeing more loan modifications and foreclosures and once loans go through either of those processes the loans go out of those databases,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. But he cautioned “they might come back. The recidivism on those loans is very high.”For subprime borrowers, the outlook remained bleak.Nearly 19 percent of all subprime loans, or 1.1 million mortgages, were either delinquent by more than 30 days or in foreclosure, up from 17.9 percent at the end of last year. About 140,000 subprime mortgages entered foreclosure, a process that can last several months, in the first three months. About 20,000 of those were in California.“The storm of foreclosure is happening silently across the country,” said Martin D. Eakes, chief executive of the Center for Community Self-Help, a nonprofit organization based in North Carolina that operates a credit union and the Center for Responsible Lending.Mr. Eakes, who was speaking at the Fed hearing, criticized the central bank for failing to use its authority over mortgage lending to curb practices that, he said, caused the current problems by giving people loans they could not afford.Fed officials did not directly respond to the complaints. But in opening remarks, Randall S. Kroszner, a governor on the Fed’s board, said the central bank shared responsibility over mortgage lending with other state and federal regulators.“Rising foreclosures in the subprime market over the past year have led the board to consider whether and how it should use its rulemaking authority to address these concerns,” Mr. Kroszner said. “In doing so, however, we must walk a fine line. We must determine how we can help to weed out abuses while also preserving incentives for responsible lenders.”The Fed first heard from a panel of mortgage lenders and non-profit housing groups and in the afternoon from a panel of state regulators, attorneys general and academics.In the morning, representatives from mortgage companies and an association of mortgage brokers parried, mostly in good humor, with people representing nonprofit housing groups that are the leading advocacy voice speaking on behalf of subprime borrowers.The opposing sides appeared to agree that the mortgage industry got carried away in the recent housing boom but disagreed sharply on the scope of the problem and what should be done.The nonprofit housing advocates attacked no-documentation loans, in which lenders do not verify that borrowers earn incomes listed on loan applications; prepayment penalties, which make it more expensive to refinance; and underwriting practices that overlook whether borrowers can ultimately repay their loans.Lenders generally argued against new regulations, saying that most of the practices being criticized may have been abused but can be very effective in helping lower-income borrowers if used prudently.“There are folks that do this business the right way,” said Pablo Sanchez, a national mortgage production specialist with JPMorgan. “I would hate to have this as the last record that this is all the lenders’ fault.”"
48,"After the first cracks in the subprime mortgage business appeared late last year, several large lenders were forced into bankruptcy.Now, the stress is sending tremors down Wall Street, as investment funds that bought a stake in those loans are starting to wobble.Industry officials say they expect this second act to be longer and slower, unwinding over the next 12 to 18 months. The fallout could further constrict consumers with weak, or subprime, credit while helping to prolong the housing downturn.On Wall Street, the impact could be far more significant: It could force banks, hedge funds and pension funds to acknowledge substantial losses, which had been tucked away in complex investment vehicles that are hard to evaluate. In turn, that could limit the money available for mortgage lending.Yesterday, two hedge funds operated by a division of Bear Stearns, an investment bank that is a dominant player in mortgage bonds, fought for their survival as three lenders — Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase — asked Bear Stearns to put up more capital.The funds appeared to have won a reprieve after executives at Bear Stearns Asset Management told creditors that they had lined up $500 million in new capital from a consortium led by Citigroup and Barclays, the British bank, according to a person who had been briefed but was not authorized to speak publicly. Last week, the fund sold about $3.6 billion in high-grade securities backed by subprime mortgages.It remained unclear whether the new financing, with the details expected to be worked out today, will be enough to put off plans by Merrill Lynch to seize and auction $400 million of the Bear funds’ assets.“Basically, Bear is trying to prevent the great unwind of their fund,” said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a consulting firm that helps investors gauge risk. “The reason people are watching this carefully is because they’re wondering whether this is going to lead to others doing the same, or will this be contained.”Bad bets on risky subprime securities and the direction of an index that tracks subprime bonds caused the High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage fund of Bear Stearns to tumble 23 percent in the year through the end of April. A related fund has fallen less.The leveraged fund, which had raised $600 million in investments when it was started 10 months ago, leveraged itself, or borrowed, about $6 billion from numerous Wall Street banks and brokerage houses. When losses began mounting this spring, some investors stepped forward to redeem their money. In May, the fund stopped allowing redemptions.So far, the distress has been muted, which has surprised some investors and analysts who believed that rising defaults by homeowners would have left investors with sizable losses by now.But Ms. Tavakoli and other industry specialists noted that the housing market moves slowly, much more so than, say, the stock market. Also, subprime mortgages are packaged in securities that are structured to withstand relatively high rates of default before most investors lose any money.“Mortgage finance occurs in slow motion compared to other parts of the financial markets,” said Jeffrey Gundlach, chief investment officer at the TCW Group, an investment management company that manages $85 billion in mortgage- and asset-backed securities. “This isn’t an Enron corporate bond that goes into default overnight. This is a process that takes 30, 60, and 90 days of delinquencies before it goes into foreclosure.”The riskiest portions of mortgage bonds — which also hold the promise of higher returns — are held by a small group of investors. The biggest holders of that risk are investment funds known as collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s. The holdings of these funds, which are once or twice removed from the underlying loans, are often hard to value because it is often unclear what portion of a bond they may own.Until the end of last year, many large institutional investors were willing to bet on subprime bonds and C.D.O.’s without even trying to value the underlying assets, said Louis Pizante, chief executive of Mavent, a firm that helps investors analyze thousands of mortgages at a time. Many simply placed investments in assets based on their credit ratings.Mr. Pizante recalled what one customer said last year as he asked for only a basic assessment of mortgage loans: “The broader your review is, the more reasons you are going to tell me why I can’t buy these loans.”Now, he said, “that attitude has definitely shifted,” and investors are asking for more comprehensive reviews.Now, ratings agencies are increasingly downgrading bonds or signaling that they are watching for more downgrades. The activity is driven in large part by delinquency rates among borrowers, the value of their homes and the degree to which the structure of the bonds will protect investors, said Nicholas Weill, chief credit officer of the asset finance team at Moody’s Investors Service.Moody’s says that on average most investors in bonds backed by mortgages will be protected if losses do not exceed about 10 percent.The picture is different for C.D.O.’s, which have strategically invested in the riskiest portion of the mortgage bonds. They have also done so with a lot of borrowed money.“We don’t really know the ripple effects,” said one industry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity and gravity of the situation. “It is causing a revaluation of the securities, some of which may lead to additional liquidations. That’s possible, but it’s not set in stone.”"
49,"WASHINGTON, June 19 (AP) — Construction of new homes fell in May as the nation’s home builders were battered by the crisis in subprime lending and rising mortgage rates.Housing, which is struggling through its biggest downturn in 16 years, is expected to continue to face troubles in the months ahead before starting to rebound in 2008.The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that construction of new homes and apartments dropped by 2.1 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.474 million units, 24.2 percent below the level of a year ago.The May decline was in line with expectations and reflected weakness in the South and West, which offset construction gains in the Northeast and Midwest.Permits, considered a good barometer of future activity, rose by 3 percent in May but that came after a huge 7.1 percent plunge in April. The strength last month came from a rebound in permits for apartment construction, which can be volatile. Applications for single-family homes fell by 1.8 percent last month, and have been down four of the last five months.“The downward trend remains firmly in place and there is no prospect of any near-term relief, given the huge inventory overhang in the new home market,” said Ian C. Shepherdson, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics.The National Association of Home Builders reported that its survey of builder sentiment sank in June to the lowest level in 16 years, a reading of 28, down from 30 in May. It was the lowest showing since February 1991, a period that covered the last major housing recession.“The tightening in lending standards is having quite an impact,” said David F. Seiders, chief economist for the home builders. Mr. Seiders said that he looked for construction of new homes and apartments to decline by 22 percent this year after having fallen by 13 percent in 2006.By region, construction activity fell by 19.7 percent in the West and 1.6 percent in the South. Construction was up 15.7 percent in the Northeast and 15.5 percent in the Midwest."
