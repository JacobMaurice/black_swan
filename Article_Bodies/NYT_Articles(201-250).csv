2,"HONG KONG —For all the mystique and reverence that surrounds the Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-shing, it is easy to see him as a local answer to the renowned U.S. investor Warren Buffett.Li's insights into financial markets are as eagerly watched in this part of the world as Buffett's are in the United States.So it is no wonder that Li's views on Thursday about the recent turmoil in global markets in the shadow of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States were of as much interest as the earnings results of his vast business empire.At a news conference Thursday in the metal and glass tower of Cheung Kong headquarters, Li was positive. He said his own businesses and region were well placed to withstand recent difficulties in credit markets and turmoil in equities markets.But he acknowledged that might not remain the case if economic conditions in the United States turned ugly.With ""any bad economic change in the U.S., the impact is not only on Hong Kong, but the whole world,"" he said. ""Hong Kong cannot be above any crash in the U.S.; Hong Kong will be affected.""Li, like Buffett, is admired for his investment judgment and his philanthropy. At 79, Li has, like the 76-year-old Buffett, been around for a long time and has a lot of experience in business and investing to draw on.Both are also known to be personally thrifty. Li, the richest Asian resident and the 12th-richest man in the world, once proudly told an interviewer about his cheap watch, a Seiko, later traded down to a Citizen.While the parallel between Li and Buffett cannot be stretched too far, their words and actions are scrutinized intensely by other investors for any hint of how to make a fast buck and by the media for insights into the economy and business conditions.As Li's biographer, Anthony Chan, noted: ""Every gesture and twitch on his part might signal to others that he could be preparing for some significant business move. A corporate celebrity, he would become a key barometer of the erratic upturns and downturns of business"" in Hong Kong.Added to that is the fact that Li's businesses are ubiquitous in Hong Kong. It owns supermarket and drugstore chains, a telephone company and has built a good portion of the city's housing. The company estimates that one in 12 Hong Kong people live in one of its apartments.This explains why a normally mundane corporate event Thursday - the announcement by Li of interim results for his Cheung Kong Group - is a media circus, accompanied by a battery of television cameras, an incessant burst of flashbulbs and dozens of giddy reporters, laughing at Li's frequent gags.The bottom line for his companies is that they have been doing well over the past six months in an exceptionally buoyant economic environment. He reported profit for Cheung Kong in the first half of 18.5 billion Hong Kong dollars, or $2.36 billion, up 52 percent.Through Cheung Kong and its subsidiary Hutchison Whampoa, Li oversees an empire that includes ports, commercial and residential property, telecommunications, retailing, electricity generation and energy. A lot of the business is centered on Hong Kong and mainland China, although it has global reach.Victor Li Tzar-kuoi, Li's eldest son and heir, sitting to his right, cut in with a more optimistic, or perhaps hopeful, view than his father when talking about the knock-on effects of a sharp slowdown in the U.S. economy. The younger Li is deputy chairman and managing director of Cheung Kong.""You can look at it from a more positive angle,"" he said. ""The U.S. has started to reduce interest rates and Hong Kong starts to reduce rates. That will be a positive signal to markets.""But the elder Li was cautious about giving advice on where stock markets are headed.""Everywhere there are so many experts on the stock market,"" he said.The prices of his own stocks have not been all that inspiring in recent months. Cheung Kong has risen by 11.4 percent since the start of the year, just behind the local benchmark index. The price of Hutchison shares have fallen by 2.6 percent, dragged down by a third-generation mobile phone unit that reported a loss of 11.3 billion Hong Kong dollars in the first half.Hutchison made a 14.4 billion-dollar contribution to Cheung Kong Group profit, but only because of a 35.8 billion-dollar windfall from the sale of an Indian mobile phone unit to Vodafone of Britain.Still, analysts say the luster has not gone off the reputation of a man who built vast business holdings from very humble origins and earned epithets in the local press like ""Superman"" and ""Mr. Money."" The 3G business is improving and might offer some divestment opportunities.Cheung Kong also is expanding aggressively in China. The group's last annual report cited 32 residential and commercial construction projects in China that are already in development or bring planned. That should ensure solid returns amid a strong property market.Eva Lee, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong, said the property portfolio was expected to book substantial earnings in the second half, with the prospects of more to come with Cheung Kong building up a strong land bank.""The bottom line is a good result,"" she said."
3,"TOKYO —The Bank of Japan, the country's central bank, kept interest rates unchanged Thursday in the wake of worries about a U.S. credit crisis that triggered turmoil on global markets, but the bank warned that it could not keep rates low forever.Toshihiko Fukui, governor of the bank, said keeping interest rates too low could cause more risky investment.""Distortions and the misallocation of resources could occur if interest rates are kept at levels inconsistent with the economy,"" Fukui said in Tokyo. ""Our policy is forward-looking and we can act when we're confident in our judgment.""The Bank of Japan's decision to maintain rates at 0.5 percent was widely expected because of recent turmoil in financial markets, worries about a slowdown in the U.S. economy and a recent move by its U.S. counterpart to lower rates.""Basically we see recent volatile market moves as a process of risk repricing but we need to continue to monitor market movements and underlying moves in the world's economy,"" Fukui said.Azusa Kato, economist at BNP Paribas in Tokyo, said the Bank of Japan might have to wait until November, perhaps December, before a rate increase because the U.S. Federal Reserve was expected to cut interest rates further. ""It's inevitable the Bank of Japan has to take a wait-and-see approach,"" Kato said.Later in the day, the Bank of Japan left unchanged in its monthly report its view that the Japanese economy will continue to expand moderately.The bank, which last raised interest rates in February, said that the vote Thursday, which came at the end of a two-day meeting, was eight-to-one.The bank is waiting to look at more data on the economic recovery in Japan, and pressures are high on the bank to work with financial authorities around the world.The U.S. Federal Reserve cut its discount rate by a half percentage point to 5.75 percent last Friday to try to stabilize U.S. and global markets. Kato said further cuts could be in the works.Although the direct fallout from the U.S. mortgage troubles is not expected to be great for the Japanese economy, the big question is how the U.S. economy will hold up.Before the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis emerged in recent weeks, the markets expected the Bank of Japan to raise the benchmark overnight call rate.A falter in the U.S. economy and a stronger yen pose dangers for the Japanese economy, whose major companies heavily depend on exports to the United States.In recent years, Japan, the world's second-largest economy, has been expanding because of strong corporate profits and a gradual rebound in consumer spending. The Japanese stock market was recovering until the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis hit.The Tokyo stock benchmark nose-dived last week but has been recovering this week alongside other global markets because of the U.S. rate decrease. The Nikkei 225 index rallied 2.61 percent Thursday, partly encouraged by the Bank of Japan postponing a rate rise.Complicating the bank's decision-making is a timing issue in September.If the U.S. central bank cuts its main policy rate at its Sept. 18 meeting, as many economists now expect, that would challenge the Bank of Japan's scenario of a soft landing for the U.S. economy, just a few hours before it is due to decide whether to raise Japanese rates."

5,"LONDON, Aug. 22  Susan Whittaker was desperate. Four years ago, she purchased her first apartment in the town of Rochester, less than two hours east of London. But then interest rates started to rise, and the income from the small shop she ran with her partner no longer covered their adjustable-rate mortgage.Facing foreclosure, and determined to avoid moving in with her mother, Ms. Whittaker found a way out in an increasingly popular arrangement here known as a “sale and rent back.”A private company bought her home, allowing her to avoid foreclosure; then the company rented the house back to Ms. Whittaker and her partner and they did not even have to move.The catch is that the company paid the couple less than the value of their apartment.Such deals are uncommon in the United States, and mortgage brokers say they discourage them because of the possibility of unscrupulous and dishonest lenders exploiting distressed homeowners.But desperate times call for desperate measures. While Americans fear an epidemic of foreclosures, brought on by the subprime mortgage meltdown, Britain is already suffering one.Foreclosures here are at an eight-year high; lenders have repossessed a record 14,000 properties in 2007, 30 percent more than at the same time last year, according to the Council of Mortgage Lenders. An additional 125,100 households are behind in their mortgage payments.And personal bankruptcies are at an all-time record, caused largely by a crushing increase in mortgage debt. The situation has grown so dire  as has the threat of desperate homeowners being exploited  that the newly installed government of Prime Minister Gordon Brown is trying to change the fundamentals of the mortgage system.Whether they can is an open question, especially given Britons’ attachment to home ownership, adjustable-rate mortgages and personal debt. British consumers are the most indebted citizens of any Group of 7 nation, and television shows devoted to real estate and debt advice are among the most popular programs in the country.“We live in a society where we encourage people to take on debt, and there is lots of pressure to get your foot on the housing ladder, which has proven quite a fruitful investment for some,” said Frances Walker of the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a debt adviser, in London.Currently, only 5 percent of British home buyers take out fixed-rate mortgages. The norm here is a mortgage with a fixed rate for the first two years, and then a floating rate for the duration of the mortgage.But the rate on adjustable mortgages has skyrocketed as the Bank of England ratcheted up interest rates  five times over the last 12 months to 5.75 percent, their highest level since 2001.Add the rising costs of necessities, like food and utilities, and British homeowners find themselves increasingly squeezed. Real estate experts here say that is why more and more homeowners are turning to the practice of sale and rent back.The mushrooming of the unregulated market has worried regulators and lawmakers concerned that homeowners were giving up their houses for as little as 75 percent of market value, with no guarantee they would be allowed to stay in their former property after six months, the minimum lease period here.Lawmakers are now trying to figure out how to encourage more homeowners to take fixed-rate loans, but that will not help those already facing foreclosure, or prevent the threat of predatory lending.If there is a silver lining in Britain, it is that, unlike in the United States, home prices are still rising, for now, after more than tripling since 1997. Recent interest rate increases have yet to reverse the trend. In fact, the National Housing Federation recently predicted prices would rise 40 percent in the next five years, elevating the average price of a home, which already costs about 11 times the average British salary, to £302,400, or $618,000.As long as home prices rise, distressed property owners can still sell their home and receive enough money to repay their mortgage debt  in theory. In reality, selling a property here can take several months, and by the time many owners are facing foreclosure, they often do not have that kind of time.Higher prices may push some prospective buyers out of the market, but others will simply take out larger mortgages. Owning a home is so entrenched in the British psyche that most consumers would rather take on additional debt than rent, even if they can’t afford it, say real estate experts.Some debt advisers have warned that higher demand for borrowing could result in an increase in lax lending practices and plunge more people into personal bankruptcy, which in turn could hurt consumer spending and slow economic growth.Recognizing that, Mr. Brown’s new government has come up with two initiatives intended to make sure Britain’s housing boom does not turn into a bust. The measures aim to build 240,000 homes a year by 2016 to provide more affordable housing, and to encourage lenders to sell more 25-year fixed-rate mortgages.Mortgage experts estimate that about two million mortgages will adjust to a higher rate in the next 18 months as their short-term fixed rates expire.Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages would limit the risk of such interest rate increases, but short-term thinking among British borrowers and the lack of an established covered-bond market in Britain has kept fixed-rate mortgages from ever taking off here.The United States mortgage market is financed through capital markets  hence some of the problems currently buffeting the markets  but Britain has always been a retail-led mortgage market, financed through bank savings deposits.Now Alistair Darling, chancellor of the Exchequer, is studying plans to create a legal framework to allow banks and other lenders to issue covered bonds, and to make them attractive to investors, in order to help lenders create capital pools that would finance longer fixed mortgages.Yet that task could become markedly more difficult now given the current problems with the United States mortgage market. The liberalization of the British mortgage market in the 1980s under Margaret Thatcher’s government removed some credit controls, admitting new lenders who offered mortgages with ever more competitive short-term fixed rates. Longer-term fixed-rate mortgages became even more unpopular in the 1990s when interest rates peaked at 15 percent.In March, Nationwide, Britain’s third-largest mortgage lender after HBOS and Abbey, became the first large lender to offer a 25-year fixed-rate mortgage after government lobbying and a positive development of the yield curve. “If this deal is ever going to be attractive, now is the time,” Stuart Bernau, Nationwide’s chief executive, said at the time.Some analysts remain skeptical. “People don’t feel comfortable tying themselves in for that long, and they get turned off by the penalties” of paying off early, said James Cotton, a mortgage adviser at London & Country Mortgages. Early payment fees can reach as much as £300,000 in Britain.But if the government cannot persuade Britons to change their borrowing habits, experts warn that the country may face its own subprime mortgage crisis, as consumers with tarnished credit find that only subprime lenders are willing to work with them.“That’s where the real problems will start, and we could easily see what happened in the U.S. repeated over here, ” said Steve Grail, managing director at Grosvenor Trust & Savings, an independent financial adviser in London.None of this matters to Susan Whittaker. The experience of having to sell her home and rent it back has made any type of loan out of the question. “We won’t get a mortgage again,” said Ms. Whittaker, speaking on the phone from her Rochester home. “The whole episode has put us off.”"
6,"Japan’s central bank, the Bank of Japan, left its interest rates unchanged because of worries about the fallout from the credit squeeze in the United States. Before the subprime mortgage crisis emerged in the United States, the markets had expected the Bank of Japan to raise the pivotal overnight call rate, now at 0.50 percent."
7,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 23  The financial turmoil that began with the seemingly narrow meltdown in subprime mortgages is now forcing both policy makers and Wall Street analysts to scale back their expectations for growth in the overall economy.Most economists still predict continued economic growth for the rest of the year and into 2008, but many are trimming their forecasts and warning that even their somewhat darker views could be too rosy.Global Insight, a forecasting firm in Lexington, Mass., on Thursday predicted that growth would be markedly slower for the third quarter of this year, and it reduced its forecast for all of 2007 to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent.“The economic outlook has dimmed,” wrote Nigel Gault, group managing director of North American economic research at Global Insight. Citing tightening credit and a “continuing drumbeat of bad news on housing” as well as high oil prices and slower growth in productivity, he also scaled back his forecast for growth in 2008.In Washington, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a comparatively optimistic forecast on Thursday, cautiously predicting that the turmoil in markets would not derail economic growth. Even so, the Congressional agency trimmed its previous forecast for growth this year to 2.1 percent, from 2.3 percent, and it warned the uncertainties were higher than normal.“I wouldn’t say we’re sanguine,” Peter R. Orszag, director of the agency, said in an interview. “The situation is very cloudy and uncertain. But the most likely economic scenario is continued solid growth.”As for the federal budget, the agency predicted the deficit would decline this year to $158 billion, its lowest level since 2002. But it reiterated past warnings that the long-term budget path is “unsustainable.”If President Bush’s tax cuts are extended indefinitely beyond their planned expiration in 2010, and Congress continues to protect most taxpayers against increases in the alternative minimum tax, the budget office estimated, over the next 10 years government revenue would fall $3.4 trillion short of the baseline forecast and deficits would return to more than $200 billion a year.The White House put out a statement after the budget office released its new estimates celebrating the decline in the budget deficit. “It shows that our government is on a path to meeting the goal I set forth of putting the budget into surplus by 2012,” Mr. Bush said. “Balancing the budget requires keeping the economy strong, keeping tax rates low, and keeping spending in check.”The Congressional Budget Office forecast was notably sunnier than those elsewhere.“This is one of the greatest panics I’ve seen in 55 years in financial services,” Angelo R. Mozilo, chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the nation’s biggest mortgage lender, said in an interview on CNBC.He predicted that the housing crisis would lead to a recession. “I just don’t see a light here at the moment,” he told CNBC. “I can’t believe when you’re having this level of delinquencies  equity is gone, the tide has gone out  that this doesn’t have material effect on the psyche of the American people and eventually on their wallets.”Most Wall Street forecasters are not anywhere near being that gloomy, cautioning against panic. But they are less optimistic than the Congressional forecasters.On Wednesday, Citigroup issued a new forecast suggesting growth would fall short of its earlier estimates. And economists at Goldman Sachs, who had already reduced their forecast to 1.9 percent two weeks ago, warned on Thursday that the housing market was probably overpriced by more than 15 percent.Where the budget office predicted on Thursday that the economy would pick up speed early next year and expand by 2.9 percent during 2008, many private sector analysts said they see growth of less than 2.5 percent next year, with some going lower.“I would trim back my forecast to 2 percent at best for next year, maybe 1.9 percent,” said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. “I’d still call this a soft landing, but we’re barely above the treetops.”Before the financial downturn, the Federal Reserve had been carefully trying to engineer a so-called soft landing for the economy, in which growth would slow enough to reduce inflationary pressures without greatly increasing joblessness.Economic growth has in fact slowed this year, with unemployment still low at 4.6 percent.Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress in July that the economy seemed poised for “moderate” growth of about 2.5 percent this year and a slightly faster expansion in 2008. Despite the steep downturn in residential home construction, Mr. Bernanke predicted, rising employment and wages would lead to continued growth in consumer spending and rising exports would stoke more business investment.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup, cautioned against “going overboard” about the fallout from the housing market, noting that corporations were still fairly flush with cash and have strong balance sheets that should enable them to keep investing.But in trimming back its growth forecast for the United States as well as Europe and Japan, Citigroup warned that the turmoil in credit markets had greatly increased the uncertainty of any predictions. “Ongoing dislocation in money markets has the potential to impair economic activity and any forecast of solid expansion is dependent upon a timely restoration of normal money market conditions,” Citigroup’s economists said.And even after markets stabilize, they said, investors will demand greater premiums for taking on the added risks of commercial loans and mortgages."
8,"BEIJING, Aug. 24 — After appearing immune to the turmoil engulfing the mortgage market in the United States, China suffered its first serious setback today from exposure to subprime loans.Investors punished China’s flagship lender, Bank of China, after it disclosed the biggest exposure so far of any bank in Asia. Shares in the bank, the second largest in China, fell 5.4 percent in Hong Kong a day after it reported holding almost $9.7 billion in securities backed by subprime mortgages. That is about 3.5 percent of its total securities portfolio.Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the biggest Chinese lender, also suffered at the hands of investors today after it disclosed that it was holding $1.23 billion in securities backed by these mortgages. Its shares fell 2.4 percent before ending up 0.2 percent.The potential for losses on these investments is a blow to the two state-controlled lenders, which have been at the forefront of China’s efforts to clean up its vast, inefficient banking system and halt the accumulation of bad loans.China has spent more than $280 billion since 1998 to clear bad loans from the books of its state-controlled banks and prepare them for competition from foreign banks that are beginning to expand their operations in mainland cities.Banking experts remain confident that any losses arising from subprime loans suffered by Bank of China, the Chinese bank with the biggest exposure to foreign markets, were unlikely to seriously jeopardize its financial performance.“We expect the losses are not going to be unbearable,” said Charlene Chu, a banking analyst with Fitch Ratings in Beijing. “They should be able to absorb them pretty easily.”But the unexpectedly high combined exposure of the two Hong Kong-listed banks to these loans has clearly rattled investors.The value of Bank of China’s holdings of securities backed by the American mortgages is roughly equal to its 2006 operating profit, analysts said.A third state-controlled Chinese bank, China Construction Bank, which has also floated a minority of its shares in Hong Kong in recent years, is expected to come under close scrutiny Monday when it reports its first-half results.Before Bank of China and Industrial and Commercial Bank reported their exposure to these loans Thursday, tight Chinese capital controls, restrictions on investing overseas and a strictly controlled media had left many with the impression that the world’s fastest-growing major economy was insulated from the subprime crisis.As foreign markets have plunged on fears of a credit squeeze, the Chinese stock market has continued to power ahead, rising almost 90 percent this year on top of a 130 percent increase in 2006.Analysts noted that despite slumping in Hong Kong, shares in both banks gained ground today in Shanghai, possibly because the state-controlled media highlighted both banks’ strong profit growth rather than their subprime exposure.And as central banks around the world have pumped liquidity into the financial system and eased interest rates to calm markets, China has continued to soak up cash in the economy and increase the cost of borrowing.China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, raised interest rates this week for the fourth time this year in an effort to slow growth and contain soaring consumer prices.For Chinese banks, an extended period of economic growth has allowed them to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their lending practices, according to most banking experts.According to official statistics, nonperforming loans account for about 7 percent of all lending on the books of commercial banks in China, a sharp decline from the early years of this decade when the ratio was estimated to be as high as 25 percent.However, some critics of Chinese banking changes point out that one reason for this apparent improvement is that lending has increased rapidly in recent years. With more new loans on their books, bad loans have shrunk as a proportion of overall lending.The danger for China is that in the event of an economic slowdown, a new wave of nonperforming loans could wash through the banking system.In announcing a 52 percent increase in profit for the first half, which stood at $3.9 billion, Bank of China said $150 million had been set aside to cover any losses on its subprime investment. So far, no losses have been booked.“In the future, we will closely monitor changes and prudently manage our asset portfolio to effectively control market risk,” the bank said."
9,"A rise in sales of new homes last month provided an unexpected respite from the steady stream of dismal housing market statistics lately, but economists cautioned that it was unlikely to last.As obtaining a mortgage gets more difficult even for people with solid credit and the supply of homes continues to far exceed demand, any recovery in the real estate market still appears months away.For one day anyway, investors were cheered by the news and lifted stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 142.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13,378.87. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 16.87 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,479.37, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 34.99 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,576.69.The Commerce Department said today that new home sales, measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, rose 2.8 percent in July, to 870,000. It was only the second month this year in which sales of new homes increased from the previous month.But the upturn was concentrated in the West, where sales surged 22.4 percent. That helped offset a 24.3 percent plunge in the Northeast and relatively flat sales in the Midwest (down 0.9 percent) and the South (up 0.6 percent).The strength on the West Coast, which has the highest median home prices in the country, also helped lift the national median price of a new home, to $239,500 from $230,600 in June.For the improvement they showed, the July statistics predated the credit market squeeze that has roiled the global financial system this month. Since then, banks have tightened borrowing standards considerably for individuals and businesses alike, which is expected to put a further drag on home buying.“In July, people were talking about the subprime problems, but they weren’t talking about it being a major credit crunch,” said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Commerce Bank. “Now they’re looking at it and recognizing that maybe it’s not a full-blown crisis, but it could become one.”The effect of the credit tightening — both in terms of its real effect on mortgage availability and its psychological effect on consumers — has yet to unfold.“I think there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Celia Chen, the director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy.com. “I think potential buyers are going to need to see a little firming in prices. And then I think they’ll need to be able to access credit easily. Right now, that’s getting harder and harder.”The statistics showed that builders continue to face high levels of unsold inventory. The supply of unsold homes last month fell to 7.5 months from 7.7 months, but that is still far more than the five-month supply that is considered normal. At the end of July, the Commerce Department said there were 533,000 unsold new homes on the market, down 7 percent from July 2006.With so many homes on the market, economists said prices could continue to fall for some time. Despite the increase last month, the median price of a new home in July was still lower than the 2006 median of $246,500.The rise in new home sales last month was out of step with what some of the nation’s largest builders have been saying recently about the state of their businesses. Major companies like D. R. Horton and Toll Brothers have reported double-digit drops in sales since last year, sagging profits and soaring cancellations. And the National Association of Home Builders said last week that its index of builder confidence hit the lowest level since January 1991.In a survey of more than 300 builders this month, the home builders association found that more and more are cutting prices and adding incentives like upgraded kitchen countertops and fireplaces to sell homes. Fifty-three percent of builders said they had cut prices in the last month, compared with 37 percent a year earlier. Forty-seven percent are paying financing fees and mortgage closing costs for buyers, compared with 38 percent a year earlier. The percentage of builders including upgrades at no additional charge to the buyer rose to 58 percent from 51 percent a year earlier.Because the Commerce Department numbers count home sales when the contract is signed between the homeowner and the builder, they do not capture cancellations. And many builders recently have reported high cancellation rates, suggesting that the July numbers may exaggerate how good the month was for builders.“Given the high rate of sales cancellations that home builders have experienced in recent months, it is difficult to get a line of sight to the net sales rates,” said Brian Bethune, an economist for Global Insight, in a research report.Outside the housing market, there were signs that July was a good month for American businesses. The Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday that orders for durable goods — heavy duty items like airplanes, vehicles and computers — rose 5.9 percent in July, to $12.9 billion."
10,"Gov. Michael F. Easley of North Carolina signed legislation last week that would limit the ability of mortgage brokers to charge customers above-market rates and prepayment penalties and would protect subprime borrowers from highly risky adjustable-rate mortgages.Calling the mortgage meltdown a “wake-up call,” Mr. Easley said, “If Washington isn’t going to act, the states are.”But amid his call for action was regret that if only officials in his and other states had acted a couple of years sooner, some of the mortgage problems that have roiled the financial markets and hurt homeowners might have been avoided.“I should have watched this closer; all of us should have on the state level,” he said in an interview after the signing ceremony in Raleigh. “We should have looked at our laws closer and made some changes.”North Carolina is one of about a dozen states that are beginning to make legislative and regulatory changes to protect people who resort to subprime financing. But economists and housing specialists say the actions come too late to benefit most of those at risk of losing their houses.With foreclosures expected to rise as adjustable-rate mortgages are reset and the borrowers face higher monthly payments, economists said the steps that states like North Carolina were taking would do more to protect future borrowers than help people already in trouble.The Mortgage Bankers Association reports that 550,000 homeowners with subprime loans began a foreclosure process over the last year, and specialists say that the number could double in the next couple of years.In North Carolina, the number of foreclosure filings increased 6 percent in 2006 from 2005 and that is expected to climb to 10 percent this year, said Christopher Kukla, director of state legislative affairs at the Center for Responsible Lending in Durham. “We think the worst of it is still yet to come,” Mr. Kukla said, “because there are still thousands of adjustable-rate loans out there that still will reset in the next six months to a year.”State governments have ample legal powers over the subprime market, but governors, legislators and regulators have been reluctant to intervene. They have limited staffs and financial resources to regulate the large, fragmented market, and they fear doing more harm than good — like stamping down home-lending money for working-class people or moving it to other states.In some states, officials were hesitant to help bail out people who had made bad decisions for fear this would only encourage more risky borrowing. “You know that people are not as financially literate as they ought to be,” Governor Easley said as he signed the new law.State governments are beginning to take modest action in part because the federal response has been slow.In Washington, the Federal Reserve recently began urging lenders to toughen subprime loan standards and last month started a pilot project with state regulators to collaborate on supervision and enforcement with subprime lenders.The Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, and other Congressional Democrats are pressing the Bush administration to allow Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy more home loans and have promised to hold hearings to consider action to prevent predatory lending.Lawmakers in a handful of states — including Maine, Minnesota and Ohio — have passed measures to tighten restrictions on subprime lending. Illinois, New York and Massachusetts have formed task forces and held meetings involving members of the mortgage industry, lenders and consumer representatives to figure out ways to rework problem loans. Minnesota is acquiring some foreclosed properties to resell to low-income people.Several states are considering laws and regulations to make mortgage brokers accountable for allowing borrowers to take on debts they cannot repay.In all, legislators in more than 30 states have introduced close to 100 bills intended to stem deceptive-lending practices and foreclosure, some by stiffening criminal penalties.Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Pennsylvania have rolled out mortgage programs intended to refinance loans by homeowners at risk, using the proceeds from state bond issues and money from federal lending agencies. Together, the programs amount to about $500 million but are expected to help a relatively small number of people.A $250 million effort by Massachusetts with Fannie Mae, for example, is expected to benefit about 1,000 delinquent borrowers. New York’s $100 million program would help an estimated 500 homeowners.Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard, said: “Some states are looking at bond issues and trying to craft programs that involve no direct out-of-pocket costs for the taxpayers. But that’s predicated on the premise that the borrower of new loans” can repay.Ohio plans to sell taxable mortgage revenue bonds in a mortgage-refinancing program intended to help property owners get fixed-rate mortgages on which they could make the payments.Mr. Kukla said Ohio had had a degree of success with a law passed last year requiring lenders in subprime deals to document and verify their borrowers’ ability to repay. But Ohio remains a subprime-mortgage disaster zone, with the country’s highest foreclosure rates after California and Florida.The state’s Foreclosure Prevention Task Force recently recommended that officials cajole mortgage lenders to help borrowers refinance or readjust their adjustable-rate loans. It called for $50 million in grants to help cities redevelop neighborhoods hardest hit by foreclosures and blighted by abandoned houses.Regulators from several states agreed to tighten the underwriting standards on adjustable-rate mortgages last month, directing lenders in the subprime market to verify a borrower’s income, inform them of prepayment charges and stop underwriting loans at initial teaser rates.Their action, coinciding with guidelines announced by the Federal Reserve, attracted little fanfare before the global financial markets’ recent sharp fall in the spreading mortgage crisis. Nine states have adopted the rules, and about 20 more pledge to follow suit quickly. But for some borrowers already in trouble, the new guidelines are coming too late and may even hurt.“Tightening underwriting now while these loans are resettling could expedite some foreclosures,” said John Ryan, executive vice president of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, a leader in developing the new guidance. “It helps more future customers.”Some state governments reacted to predatory lending practices effectively in the late ’90s with new regulations, but the rules spurred lenders to design adjustable-rate mortgage plans that came to dominate the subprime market after 2003.Most states were left flat-footed until the spring, when foreclosures began to mount as the interest on adjustable-rate mortgages rose three or more percentage points.Economists and mortgage specialists say they think that states will take more action in the fall when legislators return to work, but they predict that progress will continue to be mixed.“You have 50 state regulators, 50 state agencies, 50 state governors looking at a massive market and deciding to tweak it around the edges to make it more fair,” said Karl E. Case, a Wellesley College economist specializing in real estate. “That’s a very difficult task, particularly in a fragmented market.”"
11,"BEIJING —After appearing immune to the turmoil unleashed on world markets from high-risk home lending in the United States, China suffered its first serious setback Friday from the meltdown in subprime loans.Investors punished China's flagship lender, Bank of China, after it disclosed the biggest exposure revealed so far of any bank in Asia to this segment of the U.S. mortgage market.Shares in the bank, the second-largest in China, fell 5.4 percent to close at 3.87 Hong Kong dollars, or $0.50, after it reported holding almost $9.7 billion in securities backed by subprime mortgages.That is about 3.5 percent of its total securities portfolio.Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the biggest Chinese lender, also suffered at the hands of investors Friday after it disclosed that it was holding $1.23 billion in securities backed by these mortgages.The potential for losses on these investments is a blow to the two state-controlled lenders, which have been at the forefront of China's efforts to clean up its vast, inefficient banking system and halt the accumulation of bad loans.China has spent more than $280 billion since 1998 to clear bad loans from the books of its state-controlled banks and prepare them for competition from the foreign banks that are now beginning to expand their operations in mainland cities.Banking experts remain confident that any losses arising from subprime loans suffered by Bank of China, the Chinese bank with the biggest exposure to foreign markets, were unlikely to seriously jeopardize its financial performance.""We expect the losses are not going to be unbearable,"" said Charlene Chu, a banking analyst with Fitch Ratings in Beijing. ""They should be able to absorb them pretty easily.""But the unexpectedly high combined exposure of the two Hong Kong-listed banks to these loans has clearly rattled investors.The value of Bank of China's holdings of securities backed by the U.S. mortgages is roughly equal to its 2006 operating profit, analysts said.A third state-controlled Chinese bank, China Construction Bank, which has also floated a minority of its shares in Hong Kong in recent years, is expected to come under close scrutiny Monday when it reports its first-half results.Before Bank of China and ICBC reported their exposure to these loans Thursday, tight Chinese capital controls, restrictions on investing overseas and a strictly controlled media had left many with the impression that the world's fastest-growing major economy was insulated from the subprime crisis.As foreign markets have plunged on fears of a credit squeeze, the Chinese stock market has continued to power ahead, rising almost 90 percent this year on top of a 130 percent increase in 2006.The Chinese CSI 300 benchmark index added 81.65, or 1.6 percent, to close Friday at 5,217.58, a record.Analysts noted that despite plunging in Hong Kong, shares in Bank of China and ICBC gained ground Friday in Shanghai, possibly because the state-controlled media highlighted both banks' strong profit growth rather than their subprime exposure.And, as central banks around the world have pumped liquidity into the financial system and eased interest rates to calm markets, China has continued to soak up cash in the economy and increase the cost of borrowing.China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, raised interest rates this week for the fourth time this year in an attempt to slow growth and contain soaring consumer prices.For Chinese banks, an extended period of economic growth has allowed them to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their lending practices, according to most banking experts.According to official statistics, nonperforming loans account for about 7 percent of all lending on the books of commercial banks in China, a sharp decline from the early years of this decade when the ratio was estimated to be as high as 25 per cent.However, some critics of Chinese banking reforms point out that one reason for this apparent improvement is that lending has increased rapidly in recent years.With more new loans on their books, bad loans have shrunk as a proportion of overall lending.The danger for China is that in the event of an economic slowdown, a new wave of nonperforming loans could wash through the banking system.In announcing a 52 percent increase in profit for the first half, which stood at $3.9 billion, Bank of China said $150 million had been set aside to cover any losses on its subprime investment.So far, no losses have been booked.""In the future, we will closely monitor changes and prudently manage our asset portfolio to effectively control market risk,"" the bank said.Banking experts said that Bank of China's subprime holdings had been rated as high-quality investments and it was reasonable to assume that the bank would only suffer modest losses at most.""If we do see significant losses at these levels, there will be a lot of other banks around the world reporting significant impacts,"" Chu said.Analysts said ICBC's much smaller exposure would limit any financial loss."
12,"PARIS —There was a growing sense of unease Friday about the exposure of regional banks in Germany to the troubled U.S. mortgage market after a Bavarian state-owned lender acknowledged that it, too, had invested in risky U.S. home loans and amid reports that another troubled bank in Saxony could be forced into a sale to avoid failure.The news came as European banks continued to scramble for access to short-term cash amid a global credit crunch.BayernLB, one of the largest state-owned banks, did not give a value to its exposure to so-called subprime debt, which it said had been purchased through a U.S. affiliate. In reporting its first-half financial results Friday, the bank, based in Munich, said it did not expect payment disruptions stemming from those investments. BayernLB adding that it remained highly rated by international credit rating agencies. Still, the news further tarnished the image of the country's banking industry after two high-profile German bank rescues this month.""Clearly this dilutes the comfort obtained from the reassurances from other German banks,"" Matthew Clark, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, wrote in a note to clients.Meanwhile, German news reports Friday said that managers of Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, based in Leipzig, planned to meet this weekend to discuss a possible merger with another regional bank. The Leipzig bank, known as SachsenLB, only last week received an emergency line of credit of €17.3 billion, or $24.3 billion, to help it offset risk from exposure to subprime loans. A bank spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports.The disclosures come as the German authorities continue to seek to ease investors' fears of a widespread crisis, but with little effect. In an interview published Friday in The Rheinische Post, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück insisted that the vast majority of the country's banks were in sound health.""From today's perspective, we have in Germany no indication that we're going to see further shocks in the banking sector,"" Steinbrück was quoted as saying. ""The experts don't expect any spillover onto the real economy.""Nonetheless, German banks continue to struggle raising funds in the short-term lending market, forcing them to turn to the European Central Bank for cash. At an emergency auction by the central bank on Thursday, 146 banks bid for €40 billion in three-month loans. Banks made bids for a total of €126 billion in funds - more than three times the amount offered.On Wednesday, Commerzbank also made €3 billion available in the interbank market, a move that was seen as an effort to show its confidence in the health of Germany's banking system.Still, analysts said the slow drip of subprime disclosures from German banks, often coming within days , or even hours, of assurances from the financial authorities, had only served to deepen investor skepticism.""In this kind of environment, people put two and two together and get five,"" said Kenneth Wattret, senior economist at BNP Paribas in London. ""The first thing people want to do is decrease their exposure to anyone who might be holding riskier assets.""The first German casualty of the subprime crisis was IKB Deutsche Industriebank, which in late July unexpectedly disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group, with €3.5 billion to cover potential losses. At the time, Axel Weber, president of the Bundesbank, described IKB as an ""isolated, institution-specific incident.""But soon after, rumors began to spread of more subprime-related troubles among Germany's 11 Landesbanken, which are jointly owned by the German regional governments and private savings banks, or Sparkassen.On Aug. 17, these fears appeared to be confirmed when SachsenLB, in the eastern region of Saxony, announced that other regional banks had arranged the multibillion-dollar credit line. The head of the bank's capital markets business stepped down Thursday and on Friday, the bank postponed the publication of its first-half earnings by a week, until Aug. 31. It did not give a reason for the delay.A spokeswoman for SachsenLB said Friday that it had not yet drawn on its emergency line of credit. But a report in Die Welt, the German newspaper, suggested that the bank could be in deeper trouble than it had so far disclosed. The newspaper said the SachsenLB's management planned to meet this weekend to discuss a possible merger with Landesbank Baden-Württemberg, based in Stuttgart, or Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, based in Hannover. Reuters, citing people familiar with the matter, said BayernLB and WestLB, a Landesbank based in Düsseldorf, were also interested in SachsenLB.Despite these developments, banking industry analysts said blanket concerns about the German banking system were probably unwarranted, noting that only a small number of institutions appeared to have significant exposure to subprime risk. The country's biggest international commercial banks, including Commerzbank, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank, as well as smaller domestic banks like Deutsche Postbank, seem to be less vulnerable, the analysts said, because of their relatively high levels of capital and relatively diverse sources of revenue.But the regional banks have historically underperformed their private-sector peers, both in terms of earnings and capital adequacy, said Peter Burbank, a vice president at Moody's Global Banking in London.""Some Landesbanks with significant exposures may be most impacted, partly due to their pre-existing low levels of profitability and only satisfactory capitalization,"" Burbank said Thursday in a conference call with investors.He also noted these banks' relatively high direct exposure to subprime loans as well as their frequent use of off-balance sheet ""conduits"" that raise money selling short-term debt and use the proceeds to invest in assets with longer maturities, like mortgage-backed bonds.On Monday, Alexander Stuhlmann, chief executive of WestLB, described the credit crunch facing Germany's banks as ""not uncritical,"" and warned that if foreign banks remained reluctant to do business with their German peers ""other banks will also face difficulties.""Some economists worry that a prolonged credit crunch among banks will eventually begin to choke off lending to Germany's ""Mittelstand,"" the midsize, largely family-run businesses that form a core element of the domestic economy. It is a fear that is shared in France, where Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, urged French banks on Friday to ""not restrict conditions for granting credit to businesses and households.""Wattret, the BNP economist, said that for the major exporters, which are the main engines of German growth, the effect of the credit crunch has been muted by the strength of their profits and low levels of corporate debt. But smaller companies are likely to feel the pinch, he said. ""They have the difficulty that the big, cash-rich corporates don't have in securing financing,"" Wattrep said.""At the moment, we don't see any real signs of stress in this area, but that's where you would be fearful of a credit crunch starting to impact the broader economy."""
13,"WASHINGTON —The financial turmoil that began with the seemingly narrow meltdown in subprime mortgages is now forcing both policy makers and Wall Street analysts to scale back their expectations for growth in the overall economy.Most economists still predict continued economic growth for the rest of the year and into 2008, but many are trimming their forecasts and warning that even their somewhat darker views could be too rosy.Global Insight, a forecasting firm, on Thursday predicted that growth would be markedly slower for the third quarter of this year, and it reduced its forecast for all of 2007 to 1.9 percent from 2.1 percent.""The economic outlook has dimmed,"" wrote Nigel Gault, group managing director of North American economic research at Global Insight.Citing tightening credit and a ""continuing drumbeat of bad news on housing"" as well as high oil prices and slower growth in productivity, he also scaled back his forecast for growth in 2008.In Washington, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office issued a comparatively optimistic forecast Thursday, cautiously predicting that the turmoil in markets would not derail economic growth. Even so, the congressional agency trimmed its previous forecast for growth this year to 2.1 percent, from 2.3 percent, and it warned that the uncertainties were higher than normal.""I wouldn't say we're sanguine,"" Peter Orszag, director of the agency, said in an interview. ""The situation is very cloudy and uncertain. But the most likely economic scenario is continued solid growth.""As for the federal budget, the agency predicted that the deficit would decline this year to $158 billion, its lowest level since 2002. But it reiterated past warnings that the long-term budget path is ""unsustainable.""If President George W. Bush's tax cuts are extended indefinitely beyond their planned expiration in 2010, and Congress continues to protect most taxpayers against increases in the alternative minimum tax, the budget office estimated that, over the next 10 years, government revenue would fall $3.4 trillion short of the baseline forecast and deficits would return to more than $200 billion a year.The White House put out a statement after the budget office released its new estimates celebrating the decline in the budget deficit.""It shows that our government is on a path to meeting the goal I set forth of putting the budget into surplus by 2012,"" Bush said. ""Balancing the budget requires keeping the economy strong, keeping tax rates low and keeping spending in check.""The Congressional Budget Office forecast was notably sunnier than those elsewhere.""This is one of the greatest panics I've seen in 55 years in financial services,"" Angelo Mozilo, chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the biggest U.S. mortgage lender, said in an interview on CNBC.He predicted that the housing crisis would lead to a recession.""I just don't see a light here at the moment,"" he told CNBC. ""I can't believe when you're having this level of delinquencies - equity is gone, the tide has gone out - that this doesn't have material effect on the psyche of the American people and eventually on their wallets.""Most Wall Street forecasters are not anywhere near being that gloomy, cautioning against panic. But they are less optimistic than the congressional forecasters.On Wednesday, Citigroup issued a new forecast suggesting that growth would fall short of its earlier estimates. And economists at Goldman Sachs, who had already reduced their forecast to 1.9 percent two weeks ago, warned Thursday that the housing market was probably overpriced by more than 15 percent.Where the budget office predicted that the economy would pick up speed early next year and expand by 2.9 percent during 2008, many private sector analysts said they saw growth of less than 2.5 percent next year, with some going lower.""I would trim back my forecast to 2 percent at best for next year, maybe 1.9 percent,"" said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. ""I'd still call this a soft landing, but we're barely above the treetops.""Before the financial downturn, the Federal Reserve had been carefully trying to engineer a so-called soft landing for the economy, in which growth would slow enough to reduce inflationary pressures without greatly increasing joblessness.Economic growth has in fact slowed this year, with unemployment still low at 4.6 percent.Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, told Congress in July that the economy seemed poised for ""moderate"" growth of about 2.5 percent this year and a slightly faster expansion in 2008.Despite the steep downturn in residential home construction, Bernanke predicted, rising employment and wages would lead to continued growth in consumer spending and rising exports would stoke more business investment.Lewis Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup, cautioned against ""going overboard"" about the fallout from the housing market, noting that corporations were still fairly flush with cash and have strong balance sheets that should enable them to keep investing.But in trimming back its growth forecast for the United States as well as Europe and Japan, Citigroup warned that the turmoil in credit markets had greatly increased the uncertainty of any predictions.""Ongoing dislocation in money markets has the potential to impair economic activity, and any forecast of solid expansion is dependent upon a timely restoration of normal money market conditions,"" Citigroup's economists said.And even after markets stabilize, they said, investors will demand greater premiums for taking on the added risks of commercial loans and mortgages."
14,"WASHINGTON —Sales of new homes in the United States rose unexpectedly and factory orders jumped sharply in July, data released Friday showed, raising hopes that the economy can safely weather financial turmoil that has shaken Wall Street.The Commerce Department reported that new-home sales rose 2.8 percent in July after falling 4 percent in June. The increase in July lifted sales to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 870,000 units. A second report showed that orders to factories for big-ticket goods jumped 5.9 percent in July, the most in 10 months.Both reports were better than analysts expected. They were forecasting home sales to fall and were calling for a much smaller 1 percent gain in factory orders.The reports offered a spot of relief amid recent turbulence on Wall Street, which has darkened investors' feelings about U.S. financial prospects.""This is July data and this is referencing a period before the seizure in credit markets,"" said Zoltan Pozsar, senior economist at Moody's Economy.com in West Chester, Pennsylvania, referring to the housing figures.

19,"A rise in sales of new homes last month provided an unexpected respite from the steady stream of dismal housing market statistics lately, but economists cautioned that it was unlikely to last.As obtaining a mortgage becomes more difficult even for people with solid credit and the supply of homes continues to far exceed demand, any recovery in the real estate market still appears months away.For one day anyway, investors were cheered by the news and lifted stocks. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 142.99 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13,378.87. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 16.87 points, or 1.2 percent, to 1,479.37, and the Nasdaq composite index climbed 34.99 points, or 1.4 percent, to 2,576.69.The Commerce Department said yesterday that new-home sales, measured at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, rose 2.8 percent in July, to 870,000. It was only the second month this year in which sales of new homes increased from the previous month.But the upturn was concentrated in the West, where sales surged 22.4 percent. That helped offset a 24.3 percent plunge in the Northeast and relatively flat sales in the Midwest (down 0.9 percent) and the South (up 0.6 percent).The strength on the West Coast, which has the highest median home prices in the country, also helped lift the national median price of a new home, to $239,500 from $230,600 in June.For the improvement they showed, the July statistics predated the credit market squeeze that has roiled the global financial system this month. Since then, banks have tightened borrowing standards considerably for both individuals and businesses, which is expected to put a further drag on home buying.“In July, people were talking about the subprime problems, but they weren’t talking about it being a major credit crunch,” said Joel L. Naroff, chief economist for Commerce Bank. “Now they’re looking at it and recognizing that maybe it’s not a full-blown crisis, but it could become one.”The effect of the credit tightening — both in terms of its real effect on mortgage availability and its psychological effect on consumers — has yet to unfold.“I think there’s a lot of uncertainty,” said Celia Chen, the director of housing economics at Moody’s Economy.com. “I think potential buyers are going to need to see a little firming in prices. And then I think they’ll need to be able to access credit easily. Right now, that’s getting harder and harder.”The statistics showed that builders continued to hold high levels of unsold inventory. The supply of unsold homes last month fell to 7.5 months from 7.7 months, but that is still far more than the five-month supply that is considered normal. At the end of July, the Commerce Department said 533,000 unsold new homes were on the market, down 7 percent from July 2006.With so many homes on the market, economists said prices could continue to fall for some time. Despite the increase last month, the median price of a new home in July was still lower than the 2006 median of $246,500.The rise in new-home sales last month was out of step with what some of the largest builders have been saying recently about the state of their businesses.Major companies like D. R. Horton and Toll Brothers have reported double-digit drops in sales since last year, sagging profits and soaring cancellations. And the National Association of Home Builders said last week that its index of builder confidence hit the lowest level since January 1991.In a survey of more than 300 builders this month, the home builders association found that more and more are cutting prices and adding incentives like upgraded kitchen countertops and fireplaces to sell homes. Fifty-three percent of builders said they had cut prices in the last month, compared with 37 percent a year earlier. Forty-seven percent are paying financing fees and mortgage closing costs for buyers, compared with 38 percent a year earlier. The percentage of builders including upgrades at no additional charge to the buyer rose to 58 percent from 51 percent a year earlier.Because the Commerce Department numbers count home sales when the contract is signed between the homeowner and the builder, they do not capture cancellations. And many builders recently have reported high cancellation rates, suggesting that the July numbers may exaggerate how good the month was for builders.“Given the high rate of sales cancellations that home builders have experienced in recent months, it is difficult to get a line of sight to the net sales rates,” an economist for Global Insight, Brian Bethune, said in a research report.Outside the housing market, there were signs that July was a good month for American businesses. The Commerce Department said in a separate report yesterday that orders for durable goods — heavy-duty items like airplanes, vehicles and computers — rose 5.9 percent in July, to $12.9 billion."
20,"The stock market bounced back last week, with the three major indexes all posting weekly gains of more than 2 percent.In fact, it was the best performance for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index since March. An important measure of stock-market volatility, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, or VIX, dropped 31 percent during the week, its biggest weekly decline since the index started in 1990, according to Bloomberg News.The stock gains on Wall Street were mirrored in markets around the world, which have been bolstered by the efforts of central banks to stabilize the financial system after the shocks set off by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 299.79 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 13,378.87. The S.& P. 500-stock index climbed 33.43 points, or 2.3 percent, to close at 1,479.37. The Nasdaq composite index gained 71.66 points, or 2.9 percent, to close at 2,576.69. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.62 percent from 4.68 percent the previous week."
21,"In one of the most closely watched deals on Wall Street, Home Depot reached a tentative new agreement today to sell its wholesale unit to a consortium of private equity firms for a reduced price of $8.5 billion, according to people involved in the transaction.The new price is almost $1.8 billion less than the $10.3 billion announced in June.In what could prove a turning point amid the crisis in the credit markets, Home Depot was forced back to the negotiating table after the investment banks financing the deal threatened to back out. It marked an unusual showdown between the retailing giant’s investment banks and their biggest clients, private equity firms.Home Depot’s board, led by its chairman, Kenneth G. Langone, approved the deal in principle during a meeting this afternoon, these people said. Home Depot’s board is planning to reconvene early Monday morning to complete the details of the agreement, which is tentative and could still collapse.As part of the transaction, each private equity firm increased the amount of equity that it will commit to the deal to $800 million, up from $650 million each. In a major concession to the banks, Home Depot has committed to finance $1 billion of debt.Over the last two years, banks have climbed over each other to lend billions of dollars — and reap lucrative fees along the way — to private equity firms as they have swept up an unprecedented number of companies. To recoup their capital, banks resold the debt as high-yield bonds and loans in the credit markets.But when the credit markets froze because of the implosion of the subprime mortgage market, investors started refusing to buy nearly all forms of debt not backed by the federal government.Banks, including those financing the sale of Home Depot Supply — JPMorgan Chase, Merrill Lynch and especially Lehman Brothers — have become afraid that they would be left holding the bag on nearly $300 billion in buyout-related debt this year. They have begun pressing private equity firms for concessions, although until the Home Depot Supply sale they have not tried to break off a deal.At the center of this clash was Home Depot’s effort to shed the professional supply unit, one of the last vestiges of Robert L. Nardelli’s troubled tenure as chief executive of the company. Mr. Nardelli created the unit in 2000 as a new source of revenue and a way to save costs by buying products like lumber in bulk for both the wholesale and retail operations.But it never achieved those cost savings or the profit margins of the retail side. So the $10.3 billion sale, announced in June, was intended to help refocus Home Depot on its retail sales.Moreover, proceeds from the sale were supposed to help finance a 250-million share buyback, intended to help lift the store’s laggard stock price. In its announcement earlier this month, Home Depot said it would trim the price it was offering in the buyback.But Home Depot Supply is also suffering from the falling housing market, which has cut into the unit’s sales.The banks have threatened to declare that the unit has suffered what is known as a material adverse change, allowing them to walk away from their commitments. In this case, however, it is not clear whether they have grounds to do so.In agreeing to finance the deal, the banks agreed that neither “changes affecting any or all of the wholesale distribution industries for construction” nor “general financial or capital market conditions, including interest rates or currency exchange rates” would constitute a material adverse change.As both the credit and housing markets continued to fall over the last two months, the banks sought to persuade their clients into pressing for better terms on the deal in a tense series of negotiations. The talks grew so important that the chief executives of JPMorgan, Lehman and Merrill received regular updates, and several bankers interrupted their vacations to fly back to New York.Had the deal been broken off, both the banks and private equity firms faced the prospect of long and expensive lawsuits."
22,"ON its way to becoming the nation’s largest mortgage lender, the Countrywide Financial Corporation encouraged its sales force to court customers over the telephone with a seductive pitch that seldom varied. “I want to be sure you are getting the best loan possible,” the sales representatives would say.But providing “the best loan possible” to customers wasn’t always the bank’s main goal, say some former employees. Instead, potential borrowers were often led to high-cost and sometimes unfavorable loans that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide’s smooth-talking sales force, outsize fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans, and a roaring stock price that made Countrywide executives among the highest paid in America.Countrywide’s entire operation, from its computer system to its incentive pay structure and financing arrangements, is intended to wring maximum profits out of the mortgage lending boom no matter what it costs borrowers, according to interviews with former employees and brokers who worked in different units of the company and internal documents they provided. One document, for instance, shows that until last September the computer system in the company’s subprime unit excluded borrowers’ cash reserves, which had the effect of steering them away from lower-cost loans to those that were more expensive to homeowners and more profitable to Countrywide.Now, with the entire mortgage business on tenterhooks and industry practices under scrutiny by securities regulators and banking industry overseers, Countrywide’s money machine is sputtering. So far this year, fearful investors have cut its stock in half. About two weeks ago, the company was forced to draw down its entire $11.5 billion credit line from a consortium of banks because it could no longer sell or borrow against home loans it has made. And last week, Bank of America invested $2 billion for a 16 percent stake in Countrywide, a move that came amid speculation that Countrywide’s survival was in question and that it had become a takeover target — notions that Countrywide publicly disputed.Homeowners, meanwhile, drawn in by Countrywide sales scripts assuring “the best loan possible,” are behind on their mortgages in record numbers. As of June 30, almost one in four subprime loans that Countrywide services was delinquent, up from 15 percent in the same period last year, according to company filings. Almost 10 percent were delinquent by 90 days or more, compared with last year’s rate of 5.35 percent.Many of these loans had interest rates that recently reset from low teaser levels to double digits; others carry prohibitive prepayment penalties that have made refinancing impossibly expensive, even before this month’s upheaval in the mortgage markets.To be sure, Countrywide was not the only lender that sold questionable loans with enormous fees during the housing bubble. And as real estate prices soared, borrowers themselves proved all too eager to participate, even if it meant paying high costs or signing up for a loan with an interest rate that would jump in coming years.But few companies benefited more from the mortgage mania than Countrywide, among the most aggressive home lenders in the nation. As such, the company is Exhibit A for the lax and, until recently, highly lucrative lending that has turned a once-hot business ice cold and has touched off a housing crisis of historic proportions.“In terms of being unresponsive to what was happening, to sticking it out the longest, and continuing to justify the garbage they were selling, Countrywide was the worst lender,” said Ira Rheingold, executive director of the National Association of Consumer Advocates. “And anytime states tried to pass responsible lending laws, Countrywide was fighting it tooth and nail.”Started as Countrywide Credit Industries in New York 38 years ago by Angelo R. Mozilo, a butcher’s son from the Bronx, and David Loeb, a founder of a mortgage banking firm in New York, who died in 2003, the company has become a $500 billion home loan machine with 62,000 employees, 900 offices and assets of $200 billion. Countrywide’s stock price was up 561 percent over the 10 years ended last December.Mr. Mozilo has ridden this remarkable wave to immense riches, thanks to generous annual stock option grants. Rarely a buyer of Countrywide shares — he has not bought a share since 1987, according to Securities and Exchange Commission filings — he has been a huge seller in recent years. Since the company listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in 1984, he has reaped $406 million selling Countrywide stock.As the subprime mortgage debacle began to unfold this year, Mr. Mozilo’s selling accelerated. Filings show that he made $129 million from stock sales during the last 12 months, or almost one-third of the entire amount he has reaped over the last 23 years. He still holds 1.4 million shares in Countrywide, a 0.24 percent stake that is worth $29.4 million.“Mr. Mozilo has stated publicly that his current plan recognizes his personal need to diversify some of his assets as he approaches retirement,” said Rick Simon, a Countrywide spokesman. “His personal wealth remains heavily weighted in Countrywide shares, and he is, by far, the leading individual shareholder in the company.”Mr. Simon said that Mr. Mozilo and other top Countrywide executives were not available for interviews. The spokesman declined to answer a list of questions, saying that he and his staff were too busy.A former sales representative and several brokers interviewed for this article were granted anonymity because they feared retribution from Countrywide.AMONG Countrywide’s operations are a bank, overseen by the Office of Thrift Supervision; a broker-dealer that trades United States government securities and sells mortgage-backed securities; a mortgage servicing arm; a real estate closing services company; an insurance company; and three special-purpose vehicles that issue short-term commercial paper backed by Countrywide mortgages.Last year, Countrywide had revenue of $11.4 billion and pretax income of $4.3 billion. Mortgage banking contributed mightily in 2006, generating $2.06 billion before taxes. In the last 12 months, Countrywide financed almost $500 billion in loans, or around $41 billion a month. It financed 177,000 to 240,000 loans a month during the last 12 months.Countrywide lends to both prime borrowers — those with sterling credit — and so-called subprime, or riskier, borrowers. Among the $470 billion in loans that Countrywide made last year, 45 percent were conventional nonconforming loans, those that are too big to be sold to government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Home equity lines of credit given to prime borrowers accounted for 10.2 percent of the total, while subprime loans were 8.7 percent.Regulatory filings show that, as of last year, 45 percent of Countrywide’s loans carried adjustable rates — the kind of loans that are set to reprice this fall and later, and which are causing so much anxiety among borrowers and investors alike. Countrywide has a huge presence in California: 46 percent of the loans it holds on its books were made there, and 28 percent of the loans it services are there. Countrywide packages most of its loans into securities pools that it sells to investors.Another big business for Countrywide is loan servicing, the collection of monthly principal and interest payments from borrowers and the disbursement of them to investors. Countrywide serviced 8.2 million loans as of the end of the year; in June the portfolio totaled $1.4 trillion. In addition to the enormous profits this business generates — $660 million in 2006, or 25 percent of its overall earnings — customers of the Countrywide servicing unit are a huge source of leads for its mortgage sales staff, say former employees.In a mid-March interview on CNBC, Mr. Mozilo said Countrywide was poised to benefit from the spreading crisis in the mortgage lending industry. “This will be great for Countrywide,” he said, “because at the end of the day, all of the irrational competitors will be gone.”But Countrywide documents show that it, too, was a lax lender. For example, it wasn’t until March 16 that Countrywide eliminated so-called piggyback loans from its product list, loans that permitted borrowers to buy a house without putting down any of their own money. And Countrywide waited until Feb. 23 to stop peddling another risky product, loans that were worth more than 95 percent of a home’s appraised value and required no documentation of a borrower’s income.As recently as July 27, Countrywide’s product list showed that it would lend $500,000 to a borrower rated C-minus, the second-riskiest grade. As long as the loan represented no more than 70 percent of the underlying property’s value, Countrywide would lend to a borrower even if the person had a credit score as low as 500. (The top score is 850.)The company would lend even if the borrower had been 90 days late on a current mortgage payment twice in the last 12 months, if the borrower had filed for personal bankruptcy protection, or if the borrower had faced foreclosure or default notices on his or her property.Such loans were made, former employees say, because they were so lucrative — to Countrywide. The company harvested a steady stream of fees or payments on such loans and busily repackaged them as securities to sell to investors. As long as housing prices kept rising, everyone — borrowers, lenders and investors — appeared to be winners.One former employee provided documents indicating Countrywide’s minimum profit margins on subprime loans of different sizes. These ranged from 5 percent on small loans of $100,000 to $200,000 to 3 percent on loans of $350,000 to $500,000. But on subprime loans that imposed heavy burdens on borrowers, like high prepayment penalties that persisted for three years, Countrywide’s margins could reach 15 percent of the loan, the former employee said.Regulatory filings show how much more profitable subprime loans are for Countrywide than higher-quality prime loans. Last year, for example, the profit margins Countrywide generated on subprime loans that it sold to investors were 1.84 percent, versus 1.07 percent on prime loans. A year earlier, when the subprime machine was really cranking, sales of these mortgages produced profits of 2 percent, versus 0.82 percent from prime mortgages. And in 2004, subprime loans produced gains of 3.64 percent, versus 0.93 percent for prime loans.One reason these loans were so lucrative for Countrywide is that investors who bought securities backed by the mortgages were willing to pay more for loans with prepayment penalties and those whose interest rates were going to reset at higher levels. Investors ponied up because pools of subprime loans were likely to generate a larger cash flow than prime loans that carried lower fixed rates.As a result, former employees said, the company’s commission structure rewarded sales representatives for making risky, high-cost loans. For example, according to another mortgage sales representative affiliated with Countrywide, adding a three-year prepayment penalty to a loan would generate an extra 1 percent of the loan’s value in a commission. While mortgage brokers’ commissions would vary on loans that reset after a short period with a low teaser rate, the higher the rate at reset, the greater the commission earned, these people said.Persuading someone to add a home equity line of credit to a loan carried extra commissions of 0.25 percent, according to a former sales representative.“The whole commission structure in both prime and subprime was designed to reward salespeople for pushing whatever programs Countrywide made the most money on in the secondary market,” the former sales representative said.CONSIDER an example provided by a former mortgage broker. Say that a borrower was persuaded to take on a $1 million adjustable-rate loan that required the person to pay only a tiny fraction of the real interest rate and no principal during the first year — a loan known in the trade as a pay option adjustable-rate mortgage. If the loan carried a three-year prepayment penalty requiring the borrower to pay six months’ worth of interest at the much higher reset rate of 3 percentage points over the prevailing market rate, Countrywide would pay the broker a $30,000 commission.When borrowers tried to reduce their mortgage debt, Countrywide cashed in: prepayment penalties generated significant revenue for the company — $268 million last year, up from $212 million in 2005. When borrowers had difficulty making payments, Countrywide cashed in again: late charges produced even more in 2006 — some $285 million.The company’s incentive system also encouraged brokers and sales representatives to move borrowers into the subprime category, even if their financial position meant that they belonged higher up the loan spectrum. Brokers who peddled subprime loans received commissions of 0.50 percent of the loan’s value, versus 0.20 percent on loans one step up the quality ladder, known as Alternate-A, former brokers said. For years, a software system in Countrywide’s subprime unit that sales representatives used to calculate the loan type that a borrower qualified for did not allow the input of a borrower’s cash reserves, a former employee said.A borrower who has more assets poses less risk to a lender, and will typically get a better rate on a loan as a result. But, this sales representative said, Countrywide’s software prevented the input of cash reserves so borrowers would have to be pitched on pricier loans. It was not until last September that the company changed this practice, as part of what was called in an internal memo the “Do the Right Thing” campaign.According to the former sales representative, Countrywide’s big subprime unit also avoided offering borrowers Federal Housing Administration loans, which are backed by the United States government and are less risky. But these loans, well suited to low-income or first-time home buyers, do not generate the high fees that Countrywide encouraged its sales force to pursue.A few weeks ago, the former sales representative priced a $275,000 loan with a 30-year term and a fixed rate for a borrower putting down 10 percent, with fully documented income, and a credit score of 620. While a F.H.A. loan on the same terms would have carried a 7 percent rate and 0.125 percentage points, Countrywide’s subprime loan for the same borrower carried a rate of 9.875 percent and three additional percentage points.The monthly payment on the F.H.A. loan would have been $1,829, while Countrywide’s subprime loan generated a $2,387 monthly payment. That amounts to a difference of $558 a month, or $6,696 a year — no small sum for a low-income homeowner.“F.H.A. loans are the best source of financing for low-income borrowers,” the former sales representative said. So Countrywide’s subprime lending program “is not living up to the promise of providing the best loan programs to its clients,” he said.Mr. Simon of Countrywide said that Federal Housing Administration loans were becoming a bigger part of the company’s business.“While they are very useful to some borrowers, F.H.A./V.A. mortgages are extremely difficult to originate in markets with above-average home prices, because the maximum loan amount is so low,” he said. “Countrywide believes F.H.A./V.A. loans are an increasingly important part of its product menu, particularly for the homeownership hopes of low- to moderate-income and minority borrowers we have concentrated on reaching and serving.”WORKDAYS at Countrywide’s mortgage lending units centered on an intense telemarketing effort, former employees said. It involved chasing down sales leads and hewing to carefully prepared scripts during telephone calls with prospects.One marketing manual used in Countrywide’s subprime unit during 2005, for example, walks sales representatives through the steps of a successful call. “Step 3, Borrower Information, is where the Account Executive gets on the Oasis of Rapport,” the manual states. “The Oasis of Rapport is the time spent with the client building rapport and gathering information. At this point in the sales cycle, rates, points, and fees are not discussed. The immediate objective is for the Account Executive to get to know the client and look for points of common interest. Use first names with clients as it facilitates a friendly, helpful tone.”If clients proved to be uninterested, the script provided ways for sales representatives to be more persuasive. Account executives encountering prospective customers who said their mortgage had been paid off, for instance, were advised to ask about a home equity loan. “Don’t you want the equity in your home to work for you?” the script said. “You can use your equity for your advantage and pay bills or get cash out. How does that sound?”Other documents from the subprime unit also show that Countrywide was willing to underwrite loans that left little disposable income for borrowers’ food, clothing and other living expenses. A different manual states that loans could be written for borrowers even if, in a family of four, they had just $1,000 in disposable income after paying their mortgage bill. A loan to a single borrower could be made even if the person had just $550 left each month to live on, the manual said.Independent brokers who have worked with Countrywide also say the company does not provide records of their compensation to the Internal Revenue Service on a Form 1099, as the law requires. These brokers say that all other home lenders they have worked with submitted 1099s disclosing income earned from their associations.One broker who worked with Countrywide for seven years said she never got a 1099.“When I got ready to do my first year’s taxes I had received 1099s from everybody but Countrywide,” she said. “I called my rep and he said, ‘We’re too big. There’s too many. We don’t do it.’ ”A different broker supplied an e-mail message from a Countrywide official stating that it was not company practice to submit 1099s. It is unclear why Countrywide apparently chooses not to provide the documents. Countrywide boasts that it is the No. 1 lender to minorities, providing those borrowers with their piece of the American homeownership dream. But it has run into problems with state regulators in New York, who contended that the company overcharged such borrowers for loans. Last December, Countrywide struck an agreement with Eliot Spitzer, then the state attorney general, to compensate black and Latino borrowers to whom it had improperly given high-cost loans in 2004. Under the agreement, Countrywide, which cooperated with the attorney general, agreed to improve its fair-lending monitoring activities and set up a $3 million consumer education program.But few borrowers of any sort, even the most creditworthy, appear to escape Countrywide’s fee machine. When borrowers close on their loans, they pay fees for flood and tax certifications, appraisals, document preparation, even charges associated with e-mailing documents or using FedEx to send or receive paperwork, according to Countrywide documents. It’s a big business: During the last 12 months, Countrywide did 3.5 million flood certifications, conducted 10.8 million credit checks and 1.3 million appraisals, its filings show. Many of the fees go to its loan closing services subsidiary, LandSafe Inc.According to dozens of loan documents, LandSafe routinely charges tax service fees of $60, far above what other lenders charge, for information about any outstanding tax obligations of the borrowers. Credit checks can cost $36 at LandSafe, double what others levy. Some Countrywide loans even included fees of $100 to e-mail documents or $45 to ship them overnight. LandSafe also charges borrowers $26 for flood certifications, for which other companies typically charge $12 to $14, according to sales representatives and brokers familiar with the fees.LAST April, Countrywide customers in Los Angeles filed suit against the company in California state court, contending that it overcharged borrowers by collecting unearned fees in relation to tax service fees and flood certification charges. These markups were not disclosed to borrowers, the lawsuit said.Appraisals are another profit center for Countrywide, brokers said, because it often requires more than one appraisal on properties, especially if borrowers initially choose not to use the company’s own internal firm. Appraisal fees at Countrywide totaled $137 million in 2006, up from $110 million in the previous year. Credit report fees were $74 million last year, down slightly from 2005.All of those fees may soon be part of what Countrywide comes to consider the good old days. The mortgage market has cooled, and so have the company’s fortunes. Mr. Mozilo remains undaunted, however.In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he conceded that Countrywide’s balance sheet had to be strengthened. “But at the end of the day we could be doing very substantial volumes for high-quality loans,” he said, “because there is nobody else in town.”"

28,"United States consumer confidence deteriorated in August to its lowest level in a year on concerns about a softening labor market and market turmoil stemming from the subprime mortgage crisis.The Conference Board said its index on consumer sentiment fell to 105.0 in August from a downwardly revised 111.9 in July. In August 2006, the index was 100.2.The median forecast among economists polled by Reuters was 104 compared with an originally reported 112.6 in July, which was the highest figure since August 2001.Consumers’ assessment of current and future conditions also worsened this month. The business research group’s present situation index fell to 130.3 from a downwardly adjusted 138.3 in July. The expectations index declined to 88.2 in August compared with a downwardly revised 94.4 in July.Inflation expectations held steady despite lower gasoline prices, the report showed.Consumers’ expectations for the inflation rate 12 months stood at 5.1 percent in August, unchanged from July.On the labor front, consumers who said jobs were “plentiful” declined to 27.5 percent in August from a downwardly revised 30.0 percent in July, the Conference Board said. Those who said jobs were “hard to get” rose to 19.7 percent in August from an upwardly adjusted 18.7 percent in July."
29,"HONG KONG —DBS, Singapore's largest bank, said Monday that it would provide emergency liquidity for an asset-backed financial instrument worth 1.4 billion Singapore dollars after investors withdrew support due to volatile credit markets, making it the latest Asian bank to declare unexpected exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.DBS said in a statement that it had not previously defined its obligations to the instrument, named Red Orchid Secured Assets, or Rosa, as directly exposed to collateralized debt obligations because it believed it would be financed by investors.Rosa needed the financial lifeline because of turmoil in credit markets caused by fallout from U.S. subprime mortgage defaults, DBS said. Rosa, an off-balance sheet structure called a conduit, held 1.1 billion dollars, or $720,000, of CDOs, which are bundles of bonds and loans.""I don't think DBS will be the only one who's missed something the first time,"" Deborah Schuler, senior vice president at Moody's Investors Service, said Tuesday.Banks' use of special-purpose vehicles like Rosa is under increasing scrutiny following reports that Barclays and State Street may be facing losses from units they set up that bought CDOs. Subprime fallout has roiled global markets as investors dumped riskier assets and lenders tightened credit.""We initially did not include Rosa as part of DBS's own exposure to CDOs on the assumption that Rosa would continue to be funded by investors,"" the bank said. ""Following the market volatility in recent weeks, some asset-backed commercial paper conduits, including Rosa, have had to draw on liquidity facilities provided by banks.""DBS was the biggest contributor to the decline in the benchmark Straits Times index. The bank's shares closed 2.9 percent lower Tuesday at $19.80.""It is not so much about how much of the CDOs that the banks have, but the quality,"" said Teng Ngiek Lian, a fund manager at Target Asset Management in Singapore. ""That is what is difficult to ascertain at this point.""Most of the CDO assets in Rosa are rated AAA and DBS said it does not expect these to default.Almost half of all CDOs sold in the United States in 2006 contained subprime debt, according to a March report by Moody's Investors Service. Lenders selling the asset-backed debt typically offer guarantees from banks, which promise more money when it is needed.""It's the more internationally active banks that have done this,"" David Marshall, managing director of Fitch Ratings in Hong Kong, said Tuesday. ""The size of this structure is very small relative to DBS's assets. We would not expect it will have any difficulty in raising funding for this vehicle.""Rosa has total assets of 1.4 billion dollars, which can be backed by funds provided by DBS, the bank said. DBS has $128.6 billion of assets, data compiled by Bloomberg show.Of DBS's CDOs, the amount with ""some exposure"" to the U.S. subprime market remains unchanged at $188 million of investments, or 12 percent of its holdings of the securities, the bank said.""DBS has one of the strongest capital positions of banks operating in Asia, and we have minimal exposure to the U.S. subprime market,"" said Jeanette Wong, the chief financial officer.More disclosures from Asian financial institutions about holdings of CDOs may surface as the banks look again at their books amid growing investor concerns about liquidity, Schuler, of Moody's, said by phone from Singapore.Still, Asian financial institutions are not likely to own a lot of securities tied to U.S. subprime mortgages, she said.Rams Home Loans Group in Australia said it would try to sell more mortgage-backed bonds in the domestic market after failing to refinance 6.18 billion Australian dollars of short-term debt in the United States this month, Bloomberg News reported from Melbourne.The Sydney-based company plans to increase its funding from residential mortgage-backed securities in Australia to 4.07 billion dollars, or about $3.4 billion, from 3.8 billion dollars as of June 30, it said in a statement.No Australian lender has sold mortgage-backed securities in the local market since July 27, underscoring the difficulties faced by nonbank home-loan firms in financing their businesses amid the current credit crisis. Rams shares have slumped 57 percent since the company's ill-timed listing a month ago, making it an increasingly attractive takeover target.""Banks have looked at it before, so you would think at half the price they would look at it more closely,"" said David Goode, a credit analyst at Challenger Financial Services in Melbourne.Rams shares fell 9 cents, or 7.8 percent, to 1.07 dollars in Sydney, compared with the 2.50 dollars investors paid before its listing in July."
30,"The walls are bare, the closets are empty, and Connie and Timothy Pent and their two teenage children are living out of boxes as they wait for a dreaded knock at the door of their three-bedroom house in Ocala, Florida.They have fallen behind in payments on their home loan, and their lender told them in July that foreclosure was imminent.""We thought we were fine,"" said Connie regretfully. ""You never know.""An increasing number of American homeowners and prospective homeowners are getting caught up in the fast-spreading mortgage crisis that is taking its toll on people from all income levels and demographic groups. Like the Pents, many are trying desperately to get their loan terms reworked but are finding it difficult in a tightened market.For five years, the U.S. housing boom put money in the pockets of American lenders, brokers, realtors and investors and granted easy mortgages to homeowners with both good and blemished credit. But as home prices decline and interest rates climb, the cracks in the housing market's foundation are widening.Exotic mortgages, once hailed for helping to increase U.S. homeownership to its highest level at 68.9 percent, have become the undoing of many. Loans with adjustable rates, payment choices and loose requirements have trapped borrowers into too-high payments with few options for escape. Some have taken on second and third jobs, depleted savings, retirement and college funds and wrestled with lenders to stave off foreclosure. Those who fail see their homes sold at auction.""The increasing availability of mortgages has been an important and positive long-term trend,"" Doug Elmendorf, a Brookings Institution economist, said. ""But like many positive developments, this one was taken to an unjustifiable extreme.""Many of the people with high mortgage payments are subprime borrowers - those like the Pents who do not qualify for market interest rates because of blemishes on their credit record. The Center for Responsible Lending, a nonprofit organization that works to eliminate abusive practices in home mortgages, estimates that 2.2 million subprime home loans made in recent years have ended or soon will end in foreclosure.But there are many other ways to be hurt in the mortgage crunch.Many prospective home buyers, through little fault of their own, are having trouble getting mortgages because of the changing market. Others spent more than they could afford, piled up huge loans based on the inflated value of their property and did not fully understand the interest rates they would have to pay.Nearly $1.12 trillion worth of hybrid and traditional adjustable-rate mortgages were lent in 2005 and 2006, while $779.13 billion of interest-only adjustable-rate mortgages were issued in that period, according to a survey from the Mortgage Bankers Association.Many of these loans offered low ""teaser"" interest rates that reset through 2009, slamming borrowers with higher rates.Attempts to rework troubled loans will become increasingly common since foreclosure benefits neither lender nor borrower, said James Gaines, a research economist with The Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University.The problem is that the lender may not have any authority to redo them because of the way loans are now bundled and resold, with repayment risk changing hands several times.""It's unlike the old days where the bank you borrowed from just kept your loan on the books,"" he said.David Downs, a professor of real estate at Virginia Commonwealth University, said he believes that blame for the current quagmire falls on all involved, but that the consumer should be held accountable first.""If somebody takes on financial risk, it's incumbent on the consumer to understand that,"" Downs said."
31,"NEW DELHI —Politicians, regulators and financial specialists outside the United States are seeking a role in oversight of American markets, banks and rating agencies in the wake of recent problems related to subprime mortgages.Their argument is simple: The United States is exporting financial products, but losses to investors in other countries suggest that American regulators are not properly monitoring the products or alerting investors to the risks.""We need an international approach, and the United States needs to be part of it,"" said Peter Bofinger, a member of the German government's economics advisory board and a professor at the University of Würzburg.While regulators in the United States have not been receptive to the idea in the past, analysts said that Europe and Asia have more leverage this time around. Washington might have to yield if it wants to succeed in imposing bilateral regulations on state-owned investment funds from other emerging economies.""America depends on the rest of the world to finance its debt,"" Bofinger said. ""If our institutions stopped buying their financial products, it would hurt.""Banks and investment funds from China to France were hit with losses after buying mortgage-related securities and complex financial products based on them in the United States. In many cases, investors were caught by surprise because American ratings agencies gave the products top ratings, leading buyers to believe there was little risk. International investors are also asking why American banks were allowed to give mortgages to home buyers who could not repay them.""In a globalized economy with hedge funds, leveraged buyouts and all these investment funds, we have to ask the question about more transparency,"" said Claude Bebear, the chairman of the supervisory board of AXA, the largest French insurer.Half a dozen U.S. banking and financial regulators - including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board - would not comment. Several mentioned, however, that they were not the sole regulators of the subprime market.In Europe, the credit crisis appears to have emboldened those who have pushed for stricter international rules for some time.The German government was rebuffed by Washington and London earlier when it pushed for an international code of conduct for hedge funds. Now some economic advisers to the German government are going further, suggesting that rating agencies should be nationalized, that large-scale loans be registered publicly and that minimum standards be developed for complex debt securities.The head of the French Council of Economic Analysis, which advises the prime minister, said hedge funds should be subject to stricter disclosure rules about their risk exposure.Christian de Boissieu, president of the group and a member of the Committee for Credit and Investment Institutions, which helps regulate the French banking sector, is also calling for a global register of all hedge funds. In addition, he said, complex securities should be scrutinized before being authorized for banking portfolios.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has vowed to ""moralize financial capitalism"" has asked his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, to prepare a proposal for stricter disclosure rules on market participants before a Group of Seven finance minister meeting in October.On Monday, in a foreign policy speech, Sarkozy called again for an enhanced global rule book to avoid financial crises. Such crises could recur, ""if the leaders of major countries fail to take resolute concerted action to foster transparency and regulation of international markets,"" Sarkozy said.The United States and Britain are the genesis of the bulk of the world's sophisticated financial products, like the ones that broke down recently, in part because Wall Street banks have a big presence in both countries.""At the heart of the issue is that the largest financial institutions continue to innovate and create ever more sophisticated products,"" said Chris Rexworthy, director of enhanced regulatory services at IMS Consulting, a London compliance consulting firm, and a former regulator with the British Financial Services Authority.Regulators around the world talk about the importance of stress-testing, Rexworthy said, but the recent developments create concerns that ""institutions are either not investing enough effort in this, getting it wrong, or just producing things too complex for their risk-assessment models to cope with,"" he said. ""Greater cooperation on the international stage between regulators is undoubtedly one of the things we need to see more of.""U.S. regulators are aware of the problem. American banking and financial services regulators conducted a series of surveys and reviews dating back to 2005 that found that credit standards had loosened for home loans, and that borrowers in some cases did not understand or qualify for the loans they were given.Some financial institutions are managing the risk from nontraditional mortgage loans by following more prudent underwriting, the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation said in September 2006, while some are ""spreading the risk of these products to investors.""Some American regulators have been pushing for more international cooperation in general. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been discussing greater hedge fund oversight in recent months, and it signed several cooperation agreements with regulators from China to Germany in the past 12 months.The commission is a ""very active member"" of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the global body that brings together all securities regulators, said Andrew Larcos, the international group's public affairs officer. ""They do understand the need for closer international cooperation."" Still, he added, because the subprime mortgage loans that kicked off this current crisis were primarily from the United States, the situation ""obviously raises questions about how that market is regulated.Regulators have stepped up their cooperation in recent years, he said, agreeing, for example, to share information about enforcement activity after the near collapse of Parmalat, an Italian dairy company.In the United States, much of the blame is being focused on rating agencies, which are paid by banks for rating products, and who sometimes attached investment-grade ratings to securities that turned out to be less so.Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and Josh Rosner, the managing director of the research firm Graham Fisher, have pushed for more oversight of ratings agencies.""It's not just the U.S. regulators that failed, though they did fail,"" Rosner said. International banking regulators have ""thrown the keys to the rating agencies,"" which have been left in charge of the safety and soundness of bank capital, insurance and pension money.In Australia, where investors have embraced financial products like derivatives and swaps, several hedge funds were hard hit by exposure to subprime loans, and analysts said they expected it would be months before the extent of the problem is seen.As geographical boundaries are broken down, ""a problem in one location is a problem everywhere,"" said Dick Bryan, a professor of economics at the University of Sydney. In the aftermath of a credit crunch, "" there is the need to challenge the sovereignty of national regulators - why should the rules of lending in the U.S. be left to U.S. regulators when the consequences go everywhere?""Asian nations were pushing for some regional cooperation even before the credit crisis, as cross-border investing and their equity markets have boomed. The South Korean market regulator, the Financial Supervisory Committee, has been particularly vocal on the issue.""Regulators and policy makers in the region are quietly looking at the unfolding developments and asking many questions to themselves about what's happening and what should be done,"" said Douglas Kim, a spokesman for the South Korea regulator. ""Few would doubt that more policy cooperation and coordination are in the region's interest even in times of market calm,"" he said.In general, Washington's reaction has been that it wants ""no form of oversight,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund. ""We're talking about America's most dynamic export industry.""But economists expect an increase in international standards and regulation, not the least because Washington was growing more concerned about imposing standards on large and growing investment funds controlled by countries like Russia and China.American regulators ""have to give on something,"" said Stephen Jen, head of currency research at Morgan Stanley.Katrin Bennhold reported from Paris."

33,"WASHINGTON —U.S. stocks fell about 2 percent Tuesday, mirroring drops in Europe, after the U.S. Federal Reserve made clear that inflation remained its primary concern and American consumers and German companies said they were less confident in the economic outlook amid volatility in global financial markets.Confidence in German business confidence slipped in August for the third consecutive month, the Ifo Institute's closely watched survey showed, but the decline was smaller than most analysts had expected.The inflation rate in Germany held steady in August at 2 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said Tuesday.While worries over the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis may have dented optimism in Germany, Ifo and analysts said that signs still pointed to strong economic growth in the largest European economy.""The outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism, albeit somewhat weaker,"" Hans-Werner Sinn, president of Ifo, said. ""Here the turbulences in financial markets may have played a role.""Ifo, which is based in Munich, said its business confidence index slipped to 105.8 points in August from 106.4 in July.In the United States, consumer confidence weakened in August, the Conference Board said, with its consumer confidence index declining to 105 from a revised reading of 111.9 in July, which was a six-year high. But while the index retreated, it was slightly stronger than the average analyst forecast.In the minutes from its Aug. 7 meeting, the Federal Reserve noted that worsening financial market conditions might require a policy response but still held firm to its focus on inflationary risks.""Members expected a return to more normal market conditions, but recognized that the process likely would take some time, particularly in markets related to subprime mortgages,"" the central bank's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said.But data from Standard and Poor's and the economist Robert Shiller showed Tuesday that U.S. house prices suffered their worst decline in at least 20 years in the second quarter."
34,"FRANKFURT —Stock exchanges fell on both sides of the Atlantic after reports Tuesday showed that consumers and companies alike said they were less confident in the economic outlook amid volatility in global financial markets.Confidence in German business confidence slipped in August for the third month in a row, the Ifo Institute's closely watched survey showed, but the decline was smaller than most analysts had expected.In the United States, consumer confidence weakened in August, the Conference Board said, with its consumer confidence index declining to 105 from a revised reading of 111.9 in July, which was a six-year high.But while the index retreated, it was slightly stronger than the average analyst forecast.""The volatility in financial markets and continued subprime housing woes may have played a role in dampening consumers' spirits,"" said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center.U.S. house prices suffered their worst decline in at least 20 years in the second quarter, and there is no sign of a bottom for the market, according to data from Standard and Poor's and the economist Robert Shiller.The S&P/Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index fell 3.2 percent to 183.89 last quarter from the same period in 2006, its sharpest decline since the index was created in 1987, S&P said.

35,"WASHINGTON —Faced with a possible tidal wave of home foreclosures beginning this autumn, Democrats and Republicans in the United States are battling over a philosophical question with huge practical implications: Should the government ride to the rescue?Both the administration of President George W. Bush and Democratic leaders in Congress agree that legions of homeowners could be overwhelmed in the next 18 months, when low teaser rates expire on more than two million adjustable-rate mortgages, and monthly payments increase sharply.More ominously, falling real estate prices and a pullback among mortgage lenders are expected to make it more difficult for overstretched home buyers to refinance their way out of trouble or simply sell their houses.""This is really just the beginning,"" said Karen Weaver, director of securitization research at Deutsche Bank. ""There's a big wave of defaults coming over the next 12 to 18 months.""From a political perspective, the wave would be crashing during the primary and general election campaigns next year.But the Bush administration and congressional Democrats are ideologically divided about what Washington should do. Administration officials are reluctant to bail out people who bought homes they could not afford or simply gambled that easy credit and rising real estate prices would lead to quick profits.Democrats, though opposed to a broad bailout, are proposing an array of measures to help lower-income people renegotiate their loans and stay in their homes.""You cannot simply decree that there will be no foreclosures,"" said Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ""You can't just give people a free ride.""At the same time, Frank and other Democrats are pushing for changes that they hope will free more money for lower-income families and shift the balance of power between borrowers and lenders.The proposals would expand the program of insuring home loans under the Federal Housing Administration, part of the Department of Housing and Urban Development; create a national fund for ""affordable housing""; expand the ability of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored finance companies, to buy renegotiated subprime mortgages; and give bankruptcy judges more power to order easier terms for borrowers.The Bush administration, with the Treasury Department leading the efforts, is looking for more limited solutions. Administration officials are working on their own ideas to let the FHA insure slightly more expensive homes, which could make it easier for people with low incomes or weak credit to switch out of subprime mortgages and into more traditional fixed-rate loans.Robert Steel, under secretary of the Treasury for domestic finance, has been put in charge of developing other ideas, but administration officials have said little about what those might be.""The president has asked Treasury to be clearly focused on actions that can be taken, things we can do, to help mortgage holders who are in danger of losing their homes,"" said Jennifer Zuccarelli, a spokeswoman for the Treasury. ""We are looking at all other options to help stressed borrowers.""For the past six years, administration officials have followed a laissez-faire approach, saying they did not want to restrict innovative mortgage products.But it may be difficult to continue that hands-off policy much longer. The number of foreclosure filings in July was almost double that of a year ago, according to RealtyTrac, which provides real estate data. About 13 percent of adjustable subprime mortgages are past due, but most of the problems are on loans whose monthly payments have not yet been adjusted upward.Deutsche Bank estimates that about $400 billion in subprime loans are scheduled for rate increases of 30 percent and sometimes more by the end of 2008.To that end, many Democratic lawmakers are pushing for measures that would make it easier for imperiled homeowners to replace their adjustable subprime mortgages with more traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. Democrats also want the administration to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy a larger volume of mortgages for their own portfolios. The two government-sponsored companies buy billions of dollars in mortgages each year, up to a loan limit of $417,000, and package them into securities that can be traded. They also hold some of the bundles of mortgages in their own portfolios to increase returns to shareholders.Democrats, including Frank in the House and Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the Senate banking committee, contend that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could help thousands of people refinance their subprime mortgages if the two finance giants are allowed to hold those loans in their portfolios.The Treasury Department has opposed that kind of expansion, arguing that the two companies crowd out commercial rivals because they exploit an implied government guarantee to borrow money at lower rates than their rivals.Treasury officials have shown a willingness to let Fannie and Freddie play a bigger role, but they argue that letting the two companies hold more mortgages - the current regulatory limit is about $700 billion for each - would pose a risk to taxpayers without helping homeowners.Frank has argued that Congress should also increase the size of mortgages that Fannie and Freddie can buy, from $417,000 now to $500,000 or even $650,000 in markets like San Francisco and New York.Some specialists warn that simply switching out of an adjustable loan will not keep all homeowners from losing their houses.""The problem is that a lot of people have bought more house than they can afford and in many cases the price has dropped a great deal,"" said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic Policy Research, a liberal research group in Washington. ""If we do a workout that allows someone to pay off a $240,000 mortgage on a house that would only sell for $220,000, have we really done them a favor?""Democratic lawmakers have proposed changes that would give borrowers more power to negotiate lower interest rates or even a lower loan amount.Supporters say such a move might benefit lenders, because foreclosing and re-selling a property can be costly - especially if real estate prices are declining. Earlier this year, lawmakers persuaded the Financial Accounting Standards Board to let companies that service mortgages negotiate changes, as opposed to the investment funds that may actually own the mortgages.Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York and chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has proposed that the government distribute $300 million to nonprofit groups that could advise families on how to refinance or renegotiate their mortgages. The Senate recently included $100 million for such programs in a spending bill for HUD."

37,"Politicians, regulators and financial specialists outside the United States are seeking a role in the oversight of American markets, banks and rating agencies after recent problems related to subprime mortgages.Their argument is simple: The United States is exporting financial products, but losses to investors in other countries suggest that American regulators are not properly monitoring the products or alerting investors to the risks.“We need an international approach, and the United States needs to be part of it,” said Peter Bofinger, a member of the German government’s economics advisory board and a professor at the University of Würzburg.While regulators in the United States have not been receptive to the idea in the past, analysts said that Europe and Asia had more leverage now. Washington might have to yield if it wants to succeed in imposing bilateral regulations on government-owned investment funds from emerging economies.“America depends on the rest of the world to finance its debt,” Mr. Bofinger said. “If our institutions stopped buying their financial products, it would hurt.”Half a dozen American banking and financial regulators  including the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board  had no comment. Several noted that they were not the sole regulators of the subprime market.In general, Washington’s reaction has been that it wants “no form of oversight,” said Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at Harvard and a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.Banks and investment funds from China to France suffered losses after buying mortgage-related securities and complex financial products based on them in the United States.In many cases, investors were caught by surprise because American rating agencies had given the products top ratings, leading buyers to believe there was little risk. International investors are also asking why American lenders were allowed to give mortgages to home buyers who could not repay them.“In a globalized economy with hedge funds, leveraged buyouts and all these investment funds, we have to ask the question about more transparency,” said Claude Bébéar, the chairman of the supervisory board of the insurance company AXA.In Europe, the credit crisis appears to have emboldened those who have long been pushing for stricter international rules.Washington and London rebuffed the German government earlier when it pushed for an international code of conduct for hedge funds. Now some economic advisers to the German government are going further, suggesting that rating agencies should be nationalized, that large-scale loans be registered publicly and that minimum standards be developed for complex debt securities.The head of the Council of Economic Analysis in France, which advises the prime minister, said hedge funds should be subject to stricter disclosure rules about their risk exposure.Christian de Boissieu, president of the group and a member of the Committee for Credit and Investment Institutions, which helps regulate French banks, is calling for a global register of hedge funds. In addition, he said, complex securities should be scrutinized before being sold to bank portfolios.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who has vowed to “moralize financial capitalism,” has asked his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, to prepare a proposal for stricter disclosure rules on market participants before an October meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 7. On Monday, in a foreign policy speech, Mr. Sarkozy called again for stronger global regulations to avoid financial crises.The Chinese central bank said yesterday that it was moving to standardize disclosure of all asset-backed securities as it increases its own market for the financial instruments. Information about loans, terms and borrowers will need to be included in any new securities in China, it said.The United States and Britain are the source of the bulk of the world’s sophisticated financial products, like the ones that broke down recently.“At the heart of the issue is that the largest financial institutions continue to innovate and create ever more sophisticated products,” said Chris Rexworthy, director of enhanced regulatory services at IMS Consulting in London and a former regulator with the Financial Services Authority in Britain.Regulators talk about the importance of stress-testing, Mr. Rexworthy said, but recent developments create concerns that “institutions are either not investing enough effort in this, getting it wrong, or just producing things too complex for their risk-assessment models to cope with.”“Greater cooperation on the international stage between regulators is undoubtedly one of the things we need to see more of.”United States regulators are aware of the problem. Regulators have found that credit standards were loosened for home loans, and that borrowers in some cases did not understand or qualify for the loans they were given.Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said in June that the department was seeking better oversight, increased efficiency and a reduction in overlap in general.Some American regulators have been pushing for more international cooperation. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been discussing greater oversight of hedge funds, and it signed several cooperation agreements with regulators from China to Germany in the last 18 months.The S.E.C. understands “the need for closer international cooperation,” said Andrew Larcos, the public affairs officer for the International Organization of Securities Commissions, the global regulatory body.Still, Mr. Larcos added, because the subprime mortgage loans that started the crisis were primarily from the United States, the situation obviously raises questions about market regulation.In the United States, much of the focus is on rating agencies, which are paid by banks for rating products, and which sometimes attached investment-grade ratings to securities that turned out to be not up to that standard.Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia, and Josh Rosner, the managing director of the research firm Graham Fisher, have pushed for more oversight of rating agencies.“It’s not just the U.S. regulators that failed, though they did fail,” Mr. Rosner said. International regulators have “thrown the keys to the rating agencies,” which have been left in charge of the safety and soundness of bank capital, insurance and pension money.In Australia, where investors have embraced financial products like derivatives and swaps, several hedge funds were hard hit by exposure to subprime loans, and analysts said they expected it would be months before the extent of the problem became clear.As geographical boundaries are broken down, “a problem in one location is a problem everywhere,” said Dick Bryan, a professor of economics at the University of Sydney.“There is the need to challenge the sovereignty of national regulators,” he said. “Why should the rules of lending in the U.S. be left to U.S. regulators when the consequences go everywhere?”Asian nations were pushing for regional cooperation even before the latest credit problems, as cross-border investing and their equity markets have boomed.Whether the outcry will result in changes remains to be seen. Soon after the 1997 Asian financial crisis, President Bill Clinton and a number of regulators and politicians pushed to remake the global financial system. But the impetus faded as markets stabilized.Economists now expect an increase in international regulation, particularly because Washington has raised questions about the need to impose standards on large investment funds controlled by countries like Russia and China.Ms. Lagarde, the French finance minister, predicted that negotiations might indeed succeed. “There are a lot of shifts happening,” she said. “Once the dust has settled we will see where the different powers stand and what will be on the bargaining table.”"
38,"The Carlyle Group propped up its credit-investment affiliate in the British island of Guernsey by buying some of its assets and extending a second $100 million loan in case the market volatility of the last five weeks persists.The affiliate, the Carlyle Capital Corporation, said the assets it sold, $900 million in loans, amount to less than 5 percent of assets. The sale will result in a loss of as much as $40 million and makes the payment of a dividend unlikely, the company said Monday.The Carlyle Group, the Washington private equity firm, agreed to lend its affiliate more money to help it survive a credit meltdown that began with subprime mortgage defaults. Carlyle Capital tapped the original $100 million loan announced Aug. 20.Carlyle Capital’s chief executive, John Stomber, said in a letter to shareholders that the credit crisis has hit debt markets harder than the currency and credit woes that led to the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998. Carlyle Capital will record the asset sale as a loss in the third quarter."
39,"Wall Street regained its composure today as stocks roared back from their worst day in three weeks, gaining almost 250 points and recouping most of yesterday’s losses.Investors appeared for now to put aside their concerns about tighter credit availability, signs that the economy may be slipping and uncertainty about what the Federal Reserve’s next move will be.Within the first minutes of trading on the New York Stock exchange, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up more than 90 points. And as has become the pattern, the biggest momentum came late in the trading session.At the close, the Dow stood at 13,289.29, up 247.44 points, or 1.9 percent. That almost made up for yesterday’s loss of 280 points.As the day began, the broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index stood at 1,432.36, near the low reached on Aug. 15, when it closed at 1,406.7o. But today the S.&P. 500 closed up 2.2 percent, at 1,463.76, while the Nasdaq composite was up 2.5 percent, as investors appeared to see a buying opportunity.The rally seemed to feed on itself throughout the day, which market strategists said suggested that computer trading programs were responsible for much of the surge.But trading was light, typical of a day in late August. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.3 billion shares changed hands, compared with a daily average of about 1.8 billion last year. Some analysts said that suggested the market’s big swing yesterday was exaggerated.“For as big as the movements we’ve seen the last two days, the volume has been pretty low,” said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, an investing and financial research firm in Tacoma, Wash. “So I’m not sure I take too much from this. When you have small volumes you can have large movements dictated by relatively few market participants.”The slide on Wall Street yesterday plagued stock markets in Asia overnight, prompting a drop of all major Asian indexes, while European markets posted slight gains.Concerns about banks’ earnings and losses related to the American subprime mortgage market especially concerned investors in the Asia-Pacific region, where shares of banks and other financial institutions were hit hardest.Macquarie Bank of Australia lost nearly 4 percent, contributing to a 1.23 percent decline of the country’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index.Singapore’s DBS Group Holdings  which this week disclosed a greater exposure to the United States subprime market than previously known  lost 2.5 percent by midafternoon. That added to a 1.54 percent drop in the Straits Times Index.The Nikkei 225 was also pulled down 1.7 percent by the problems in the United States, and the fall was accelerated by renewed strength in the yen, which the markets fear will harm the country’s recovering exporters.In Britain, Barclays Bank was compelled yesterday to deny rumors that it was sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars of unrealized losses related to credit funds.Part of the problem is that while it is clear that the losses have not fully worked their way through the market, no one is sure which institutions are going to have to book them.“Someone is holding the bag, but we don’t know who,” said John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC in Sydney.The downgrade of three powerhouse American banks by Merrill Lynch yesterday, from buy to neutral, highlighted the lingering effect of the subprime problems despite attempts by the Fed to reassure markets.The British markets got further bad news when Standard & Poor’s said the London-based hedge fund Cheyne Capital Management might have to liquidate $6 billion in assets backing commercial paper.The decisions by the Fed to cut the discount rate that banks use for short-term borrowing in emergencies provided some support for stocks and bonds recently, but the market in asset-backed commercial paper is still moribund.The subprime crisis was sparked by an increase in defaults on mortgages given to high-risk borrowers. Many of those loans had been packaged and sold as asset-backed securities.The crisis of confidence has spread to include almost all asset-backed securities regardless of how safe the end borrowers are.Potential buyers of asset-backed securities are reassessing the risk that they present. And markets for such securities are barely functioning, with buyers frightened of being burdened with an asset they cannot sell.The Federal Reserve Bank of New York tried to step in last week, telling banks that they could use high-quality asset-backed securities as collateral to borrow from the Fed.But the market is still languishing, and nonbank lenders are having continued difficulty getting money, a particular problem in a market where most asset-backed commercial paper typically has short maturity and needs to be rolled over regularly.Coventree, a Canadian financial services company, was unable to roll over its asset-backed commercial paper and had to be bailed out by banks.And the Australian lender Rams Home Loans Group announced yesterday that it would turn to the Australian markets to refinance more than 300 million Australian dollars, but it is likely to be an expensive exercise.Borrowers like Rams are having to pay significant premiums to obtain the financing they need.A number of nonbank lenders, like the Australia-based Members Equity Bank, have had to cancel bond issues recently because they have been unable to find buyers at an acceptable price.One of the reasons that banks are being sold so heavily in the market is that they typically offer a backstop in case the issuer of the commercial paper is unable to roll over the debt.It was this arrangement that nearly bought down the German bank IKB.But in a recent report, Keith Horowitz of Citigroup Global Markets said he believed that banks’ balance sheets were strong enough to withstand the extra calls on their capital that might be made if the weakness in the commercial paper market continues.“Our initial take is that banks will have sufficient balance sheet capacity to put these credit lines on, and we do not see anything close to an IKB scenario unfolding in our universe,” the report said."

42,"NEW YORK —The subprime mortgage crisis is spreading to a somewhat unexpected place: homes costing more than $500,000.As lending has rapidly gotten more restrictive for borrowers taking out large loans, sales of expensive homes have fallen sharply around the country during what should be one of the busiest seasons for buyers and sellers, mortgage bankers and real estate agents say.To some degree the change is due to difficulty getting financing, as borrowers are finding fewer lenders willing or able to fund ""jumbo"" mortgages, loans for amounts greater than $417,000.Jumbo mortgages are too big to be guaranteed by government-sponsored housing finance agencies, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae.Given the troubles in the subprime sector, investor appetite for all types of mortgage loans not guaranteed by housing finance agencies has nose-dived.Banks until recently were able to offload the risk of many jumbo mortgages by selling the loans to investors. But now, as investors burned by the subprime debacle have become extremely picky about what they will buy, banks are having to keep more of these loans on their own books and as a result are charging higher rates.Some lenders - like Countrywide Financial - have made a point of saying they are now most focused on making loans that can be guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie.Other lenders have simply tightened up their lending standards, for example by no longer making jumbo loans to lenders who can not fully document their income, even if they make large down payments and have stellar credit histories.The banks that are still making jumbo loans are charging substantially higher rates to compensate for the lack of investor demand. Borrowers who could have gotten rates as low as 6.5 percent in June are now having to pay as much as 9 percent.But aside from the financial impact of higher rates, in certain high-priced real estate markets the effect of the suddenly tighter lending environment is more psychological, mortgage bankers and real estate agents say, as buyers and sellers alike do not want to plunge into an uncertain future.""Showings are down, contracts written are down, and sellers are just as backed away as buyers are,"" said Lou Barnes, a partner at Boulder West Financial Services, a mortgage bank and brokerage firm in Boulder, Colorado. The company arranges for financing on many higher-priced condominiums and houses in the state.""I think the psychological damage is worse than the financial damage,"" which is already bad enough, he said. Even for buyers who have plenty of cash or can easily afford higher mortgage rates, the sudden change in the financing environment reduces ""the ardor to buy a house unless you have to,"" he added.With numerous buyers and sellers sidelined, the higher cost of big mortgages is bound to put downward pressure on home prices should the lending environment stay tight for a long period of time, said Ellen Bitton, president of Park Avenue Mortgage, a mortgage bank and brokerage firm that does business in several states, including New York, Florida and Utah.In New York, the most pronounced effect so far has been at the very top end of the market, for properties priced $25 million and above, said Dolly Lenz, vice chairman with Prudential Douglas Elliman.""Every single person I have at the highest end is on hold. They are going to wait and see what happens,"" she said. ""It has nothing to do with them being able to afford"" properties or not, Lenz added. ""It's a confidence thing. They somehow feel poorer, whether they are or not.""In California, where the median home price is well above $500,000, jumbo mortgages are as much as 44 percent of all mortgages issued in certain metro areas, according to data from First American LoanPerformance.In and around San Francisco, where the median home price is about $1.1 million, the tougher financing environment has created a ""hesitancy"" and has led to some canceled escrows for buyers around the $1 million range, said Rick Turley, president of the San Francisco and Peninsula Region for Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage."
43,"LONDON —New evidence of damage wrought by the U.S. mortgage sector surfaced in the United States and Europe on Wednesday, while banks demanded a record amount of cash at a euro-zone money market auction.

But we will have to wait a few more weeks to draw up final conclusions.""Gertrude Tumpel-Gugerell, a member of the European Central Bank executive board, said the recent turbulence showed how rapidly contagion could spread around the world, but predicted that ""confidence will return.""Financial markets stumbled in Europe despite the officials' comments, with most major indexes finishing lower.Bank Julius Baer, a Swiss investment bank, warned, ""The only thing that is certain is that more uncertainties in the direction of asset prices and volatility are on their way.""The crisis in U.S. subprime loans claimed another victim Wednesday when Cheyne Finance, a structured investment vehicle managed by the British hedge fund Cheyne Capital Management, said it was seeking to restructure after being forced to start selling assets to pay down debt.BNP Paribas, the French bank that froze three funds on Aug. 7, said it had reopened two of them and will reopen the third on Thursday.In the United States, Basis Yield Alpha Fund, a hedge fund specializing in corporate and structured credit, filed for bankruptcy protection Wednesday amid mounting losses from subprime mortgage assets.The fund, registered in the Cayman Islands and run by the Australian company Basis Capital, listed more than $100 million in assets and more than $100 million in liabilities in its filing with a U.S. bankruptcy court in New York. In court papers, Basis Yield said it began to suffer a ""significant devaluation"" in its asset portfolio in June.An index measuring delinquencies on riskier British home loans, known as nonconforming mortgages, rose almost 5 percent in the second quarter and will climb further in the second half of the year, Standard & Poor's said Wednesday. S&P ""expects the delinquency and repossession levels to worsen in the second half of 2007,"" the report said.A survey by the GfK market research group showed German consumer sentiment was likely to worsen in September because of fears of market volatility.Euro-zone banks bid for a record amount of money at the ECB's regular long-term funding operation Wednesday, reflecting tightness in the interbank lending market. Central banks have poured funds into money markets to tackle a lack of liquidity stemming from the subprime crisis, which has led many banks to cut back on normal interbank lending."
44,"SYDNEY —A court in the Cayman Islands has placed the Basis Yield Alpha Fund in provisional liquidation after the Australian-run fund's evisceration by the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.The court in the Cayman Islands, where the fund is based, has appointed Grant Thornton as provisional liquidators.""At this stage we are undertaking an immediate assessment as to the financial position of the fund and any likely return to investors,"" a Grant Thornton partner, Paul Billingham, said in a statement Thursday.Grant Thornton has applied for Chapter 15 protection in a New York court. Chapter 15, a recent addition to the U.S. bankruptcy code, allows a judge to give formal recognition to an overseas bankruptcy procedure and protects the assets from seizure by U.S. creditors while the process is being carried out.The court Wednesday granted a temporary restraining order.The Basis Yield Alpha Fund, which once had assets of over $1 billion, has lost over 80 percent of its value in the fallout from the subprime crisis. It was heavily invested in securities that were backed by so-called subprime mortgages, which were granted to borrowers with flawed credit histories.""Following the well-publicized volatility in the market related to the U.S. subprime lending defaults, by June 2007, Basis Yield began to suffer a significant devaluation of its asset portfolio,"" the liquidators said in their submission to the New York bankruptcy court.Basis Yield had invested much of the fund in so-called collateralized debt obligations, which are bundles of asset-backed securities. The market in CDOs has never been very active, but since the crisis hit, it has been near impossible for investors like Basis Yield to sell their way out of the crisis.It has been a savage fall from grace for the Australian managers.Just two months ago Basis Yield's two main funds, including Yield Alpha, had five star ratings from Standard & Poors, and the company had won 'Fund of the Year' at the 2005 Asiahedge awards and been Macquarie Bank's 'Skilled Manager of the Year' in 2004.The other group of funds run by Basis Yield, its Aust-Rim Opportunity Fund, is not in default and is still trading.The crisis has brought a number of funds and companies which had exposure to subprime-backed assets to their knees. More than 100 U.S. mortgage companies have been forced to stop their operations or try and seek a buyer; two funds run by U.S. investment house Bear Stearns are in bankruptcy; and German bank IKB had to be bailed out by other German banks.Despite attempts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to calm the markets, the volatility sparked by the subprime crisis shows little sign of going away. Stock markets across the globe have seen record falls and rises, and the shareprices of financial institutions across the board have been hit.Analysts say that the full extent of the losses associated with the subprime crisis have not been revealed and suspect that some institutions are sitting on substantial losses in the hope that the markets will recover."

47,"The stock market recovered almost all of its losses from Tuesday’s sharp sell-off as investors went bargain-hunting yesterday at Wall Street’s equivalent of a late summer sale.The morning after the market’s worst day in three weeks, the Dow Jones industrial average started the trading session up immediately almost 100 points. The rally fed on itself as trading continued, and stock prices ended the day posting some of their largest gains so far this year.The Dow rose 247.44 points, or 1.9 percent. Broader indexes fared even better. The Standard & Poor 500-stock index gained 2.2 percent, and the Nasdaq composite increased 2.5 percent.Trading was a near mirror image of Tuesday. All 30 stocks in the Dow average and all but 18 of the 500 stocks in the S.& P. index climbed. On Tuesday, 29 Dow stocks and 487 S.& P. 500 stocks declined.Market strategists said the cascading nature of the rally suggested that computer trading algorithms programmed to buy low were at work. But individual investors looking for bargains were also a factor, as were rising oil prices and word from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, that the central bank was “prepared to act as needed” to prevent the recent market distress from spreading further.Trading volume was low — typical for a day in late August — suggesting that the market’s big swings this week have been somewhat exaggerated. On the New York Stock Exchange, 1.3 billion shares changed hands, compared with a daily average of about 1.8 billion.“For as big as the movements we’ve seen the last two days, the volume has been pretty low,” said Ernie Ankrim, chief investment strategist at Russell Investments, an investing and financial research firm in Tacoma, Wash. “So I’m not sure I take too much stock in this. When you have small volumes you can have large movements dictated by relatively few market participants.”The Dow closed yesterday at 13,289.29. The S.& P. 500 rose 31.40 points, to 1,463.76, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 62.52 points, to 2.563.16.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note fell 14/32, to 101 16/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.56 percent, from 4.51 percent.Energy company stocks led the charge yesterday as oil prices jumped to a three-week high on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of a barrel of crude oil for delivery in October rose 2.5 percent, to $73.51, after the Energy Department reported that the nation’s gasoline and oil reserves fell more last week than Wall Street forecasters had predicted.After leading the market’s decline on Tuesday, shares of financial companies like Lehman Brothers and Citigroup rebounded yesterday as Wall Street saw a greater possibility that the Fed will lower its benchmark short-term lending rate by half a percentage point, to 4.75 percent, when it meets on Sept. 18. Futures contracts for the Fed’s key rate yesterday showed that nearly half of traders now expect a half-point rate reduction.The Fed has given no indication that a rate cut is imminent. But it has signaled that it is at least willing to consider one. Yesterday, the Fed again suggested that a rate cut was possible if conditions in financial markets deteriorated further.In a letter to Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, Mr. Bernanke wrote that the Fed’s policy making arm was “prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.”Mr. Schumer, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has been one of the loudest voices in Congress calling for the government to regulate mortgage lenders more closely. Mortgage companies have played a central role in the recent market tumult as banks have all but stopped buying asset-backed securities, fearing that the assets were bad subprime loans.Yesterday Mr. Schumer took aim at the nation’s largest mortgage lender, Countrywide Financial, saying the company should “bury its bad business practices and reverse some of the damage it has already inflicted on our housing market.”At issue was the allegation, which Countrywide has disputed, that the lender improperly steered customers to high-cost mortgages that resulted in richer commissions for Countrywide’s sales representatives and large fees to company affiliates providing services on the loans.Yesterday’s rally on Wall Street was helped in part by the absence of any big developments in the financial world. Recently, news that major investment banks have lost billions of dollars because of their exposure to bad subprime loans has sent Wall Street reeling.“When you don’t have any news, that’s good news,” said Todd Leone, head of trading at Cowen & Company, a New York brokerage firm.But how much the financial market turmoil has affected the economy is still not known. And investment strategists cautioned that the extent of the damage would not begin to be fully revealed until next month when economic indicators, like the government’s employment report, are released.“The maximum risk time is going to be the next 60 days when the major economic reports come out and they have some post-crisis data in them,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. “I definitely see that we’re going to have some volatile and scary days ahead.”Following are the results of yesterday’s Treasury auction of 17-day cash management bills and 2-year notes:"
48,"Zero-interest financing, a familiar sales incentive at car dealerships and furniture stores, has found its way to another big-ticket consumer market: doctors’ and dentists’ offices.For $3,500 laser eye surgery, $6,000 ceramic tooth implants or other procedures not typically covered by insurance, millions of consumers have arranged financing through more than 100,000 doctors and dentists that offer a year or more of interest-free monthly payments.Of course, going into debt to pay for medical procedures is nothing new for many people. And this type of financing is still only a fraction of the nation’s $900 billion market for consumer revolving credit.But as the price of health care continues to rise and big lenders pursue new areas for growth, this type of medical financing has become one of the fastest-growing parts of consumer credit, led by lending giants like Capital One and Citigroup and the CareCredit unit of General Electric.Big insurers, too, are devising new financing plans with various payback options. Upstart players have also aggressively cut deals with doctors.The room for expansion looks ample, as rising deductibles, co-payments and other costs may force more of the nation’s 250 million people with health insurance to finance out-of-pocket expenses for even basic medical care.“As more and more of the costs of care are shifted to consumers, people are going to need more credit,” said Red Gillen, a senior analyst at Celent, an insurance and banking research firm. “They are still going to need health care.”The zero-interest plans are not for everyone. In fact, they are available only to the creditworthy — meaning they offer no help to those among the nation’s 47 million uninsured who are in difficult financial situations.And creditworthiness is starting to be judged even more stringently, in light of the subprime mortgage crisis’s impact on the debt markets, according to David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter for the credit card industry.Even for those who can get credit approval, the plans make sense only if users are able to make payments on time and close the loan on schedule, typically within 12 months. Otherwise, the loans after defaults can carry interest rates of 20 percent or more — similar to the default penalty on a typical credit card.“We are very careful to tell patients upfront, ‘Be sure you can make your payments,’ ” said Dr. Richard J. Mercurio, a dentist in Lincroft, N.J. He arranges patient financing through the CareCredit unit of G.E., the leader in consumer medical financing.Dr. Mercurio says he knows of at least two patients who missed payments and received monthly bills charging high interest rates. “They were not happy,” he said.For those who are able to make their payments, though, the plans can make it possible to receive treatments that otherwise might be out of reach.“There was no way I had $6,000 right out of my pocket,” said Nancy Schlachter, 40, who has dental insurance through her job as an accounts payable manager for a national construction company. She went to Dr. Mercurio for a series of dental procedures including a new crown, fillings and a tooth implant.“The implant was very expensive, and it was not covered,” Ms. Schlachter said. But the dentist’s office arranged 12-month zero-interest financing. “It was the only way I could do it,” she said.Some consumer debt experts warn that as more people try to bridge widening gaps in their health insurance, paying for medical care on credit could plunge the unwary into a financial crisis. In recent years, the use of high-interest credit cards to pay big medical bills has become a leading cause of consumer bankruptcy.“Unless they are at risk of losing life or limb, people should be very cautious about putting medical bills on credit cards,” said Mark Rukavina, executive director of the Access Project, a research and consumer advocacy organization that helps people with their medical debts.Still, consumer credit companies and some insurers are now experimenting with financing plans meant specifically for medical costs.For people who think they could not pay off a zero-interest loan within a year, most credit companies also offer longer-term medical financing deals with 12 percent to 13 percent interest payable over several years. Those plans, though, must be arranged at the outset of the medical expense; a zero-interest plan typically cannot be converted to the longer-term program if consumers find themselves unable to pay off the one-year loans.Some insurers, including UnitedHealthcare, also have special credit plans available for insured members whose policies are linked to health savings accounts. Such policies combine high-deductible insurance with tax-sheltered savings accounts where money can roll over year to year until needed for medical expenses. But typically, the amounts of money being set aside do not go very far toward meeting even routine health expenses.So far, among the 1.76 million health savings accounts in this country, the average balance is $1,327, according to a recent survey by Inside Consumer-Directed Care, a trade publication. To help people with health savings accounts meet the shortfall, the Exante Bank unit of UnitedHealth Group is trying out a card that extends credit at rates currently averaging about 10 percent to 13 percent, depending on the applicant’s credit history.UnitedHealthcare is also testing a medical credit card that would offer reduced rates.“There’s a place for credit solutions that are integrated within traditional health insurance programs, when an individual hits that out-of-pocket expense,” said Tom Beauregard, a senior vice president at UnitedHealthcare. “The key is to make it voluntary, to make it simple and to offer favorable credit terms.”As for the zero-interest deals, the credit providers say that most of them end up being just that — interest-free. About 80 percent of the medical loans that CareCredit provides are paid off on schedule and incur no finance charges, according to the company’s president, Michael J. Testa.That, the companies say, justifies the high default interest rates for late payments, since that is the way they recoup the costs of doing business. In fact, though, the credit companies make money even on the interest-free deals, because they are typically keeping 10 percent of the fee the doctor charges the patient. On a $5,000 cosmetic nose operation, for instance, the plastic surgeon might receive only $4,500.Another of the medical finance companies, HELPcard, says that for dentists whose customers are good credit risks, the lender’s commission might be only 4 percent to 5 percent. But for patients with low credit ratings, a dentist eager to build a clientele might have to accept as little as 75 percent of the bill, said Pat McGee, HELPcard’s senior vice president for sales and marketing.The CareCredit unit of G.E., too, has special deals for patients whose credit is not well established. Stephanie Waterman, a coordinator for Dello Russo Laser Vision, a laser-surgery practice with offices in New York and Bergenfield, N.J., said patients deemed less creditworthy were required to pay $600 in cash and to agree to have 12 months of zero-interest payments taken directly from their bank accounts.One Dello Russo patient, Senior Airman Derrick Fields, 31, stationed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, said that in June he paid $600 down on a $3,500 surgery bill for both eyes — a reduced charge the practice offers to members of the military.“They take about $250 a month from my bank account,” said Mr. Fields, who said he soon expected to not wear eyeglasses for the first time since the second grade. “I owe $2,900.”"
49,"SYDNEY —A court in the Cayman Islands placed the Basis Yield Alpha Fund in provisional liquidation after the Australian-run fund's evisceration by the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.The court in the Cayman Islands, where the fund is based, appointed the U.S. accounting firm Grant Thornton as provisional liquidators.""At this stage we are undertaking an immediate assessment as to the financial position of the fund and any likely return to investors,"" Paul Billingham, a Grant Thornton partner, said Thursday in a statement.Grant Thornton has applied for Chapter 15 protection in a New York court. Chapter 15, a recent addition to the U.S. bankruptcy code, allows a judge to give formal recognition to an overseas bankruptcy procedure and protects the assets from seizure by U.S. creditors while the process is being carried out.The court Wednesday granted a temporary restraining order.The Yield Alpha Fund (Master), which once had assets of over $1 billion, has lost over 80 percent of its value in the fallout from the subprime crisis.It was heavily invested in securities that were backed by so-called subprime mortgages, which were granted to borrowers with flawed credit histories.""Following the well-publicized volatility in the market related to the U.S. subprime lending defaults, by June 2007, Basis Yield began to suffer a significant devaluation of its asset portfolio,"" the liquidators said in their submission to the New York bankruptcy court.Basis had invested much of the fund in so-called collateralized debt obligations, which are bundles of asset-backed securities. The market in CDOs has never been very active, but since the crisis hit, it has been near impossible for investors like Basis to sell their way out of the crisis.It has been a savage fall from grace for the Australian managers.Just two months ago Basis' two main funds, including Yield Alpha, had five- star ratings from Standard & Poor's, and the company had won ""Fund of the Year"" at the 2005 Asiahedge awards and been Macquarie Bank's ""Skilled Manager of the Year"" in 2004.The other group of funds run by Basis, its Aust-Rim Opportunity Fund, is not in default and is still trading.The crisis has brought a number of funds and companies which had exposure to subprime-backed assets to their knees.More than 100 U.S. mortgage companies have been forced to stop their operations or try and seek a buyer; two funds run by U.S. investment house Bear Stearns are in bankruptcy; and the German bank IKB had to be bailed out by other German banks.Despite attempts by the U.S. Federal Reserve and other central banks to calm the markets, the volatility sparked by the subprime crisis shows little sign of going away.Stock markets across the globe have seen record falls and rises, and the share prices of financial institutions across the board have been hit.Analysts say that the full extent of the losses associated with the subprime crisis have not been revealed and suspect that some institutions are sitting on substantial losses in the hope that the markets will recover."
