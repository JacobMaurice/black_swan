0,"PARIS —The French bank BNP Paribas suspended operations of three of its funds Thursday in the wake of turmoil in the U.S. home loans market, prompting more declines in European stock markets.BNP, the largest listed bank in France, is the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several major companies have already announced losses.A German central bank meeting was under way Thursday to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB, another victim of exposure to the crisis in so-called subprime lending that sprang from a glut of risky loans and the failure of U.S. homebuyers to keep up with their payments.Also Thursday, the Dutch lender NIBC Holding said it had lost $189 million on U.S. mortgage investments.Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said the credit crunch in the United States made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds since Monday, and he explained that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares in the funds.""It's quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can't buy in or sell out of the funds,"" Mullen said. ""But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.""Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans, but that those investments were in high quality parts of that market. ""We've seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,"" he said. ""This is just a technical problem about liquidity,"" he said.A key question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, Baudouin Prot, chief executive officer of BNP, said the bank's exposure to subprime woes was ""absolutely negligible.""BNP shares fell as much as 3.2 percent to €82.70, or $113.16, in early trading Thursday, but Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represent just a small fraction, about €1.6 billion, of the €600 billion the bank currently has under management.Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine banks' exposure to the U.S. subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.The debt rating agency Standard & Poor's cut credit ratings in July on $6.39 billion worth of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.Concern among investors about the possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped last week, even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms.Julia Werdigier reported from London."

Stocks remained volatile through the morning, and at 11 a.m., the Dow was down about 140 points. The S.&P. 500 was off by more than 1 percent, and the Nasdaq by about half that.Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy, President George W. Bush said, ""The fundamentals of our economy are strong,"" adding, ""I'm told there is enough liquidity to enable the system to correct.""The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses.A German central bank meeting was under way to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending.Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares in the funds.""It's quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can't buy in or sell out of the funds,"" Mullen said.

""This is just a technical problem about liquidity.""With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to inject cash into the financial system.A key question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, BNP's chief executive, Baudouin Prot, said the bank's exposure to subprime woes was ""absolutely negligible.""BNP shares fell more than 5 percent in early trading, but Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis.

Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms, fearing losses from leveraged loans they have underwritten but cannot sell on to investors.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said earlier this month that while exposures to subprime may lead to ""modest losses or slightly lower revenue"" among European banks — but that would be ""entirely manageable."""
2,"Stocks on Wall Street were down sharply Thursday after a French bank, BNP Paribas, suspended operations of three of its funds in the wake of turmoil in the American market for home loans. The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve injected cash into the financial system because of tightening credit markets.Within minutes of the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points, or 1.5 percent, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index were down just as much. Stocks remained volatile into the afternoon, recovering much of their losses, then declining anew.Shortly after 3:30 p.m., the Dow was down more than 320 points, or 2.3 percent. The S.& P. 500 was off by about 2.5 percent, while the Nasdaq was down about 1.9 percent.Prices of Treasury bonds jumped as investors fled to the safety of government paper.Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy, President George W. Bush said he did not think that the U.S. government needs to step in to provide more money to the financial markets. ""The fundamentals of our economy are strong,"" he said.""Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system,"" he added. ""In other words, is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct? And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.""The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses. Late last month, a group of German government-backed banks agreed to bail out a bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, whose investments in American mortgage securities have fallen significantly in value.With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent after the overnight rates that banks charge to lend money to one another leaped. The Federal Reserve injected $24 billion to the United States banking system to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent, after it opened this morning at 5.5 percent.It is common for central banks to step in to stabilize the financial system when banks are either pumping too much or too little money into the markets. What was unusual about the move Thursday was the size and speed with which the banks acted.""There is certainly a liquidity crisis in the financial system that the normal players themselves are having a little bit of difficulty working out,"" said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond firm based in Vermont. ""The Fed provided some assistance.""In the bond markets, Treasury prices were up and the yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the inverse direction of its price, fell to 4.805 percent, from 4.879 percent on Wednesday evening.The premium that investors demand to hold junk bonds and other riskier assets, which had gone down in the last couple days, increased somewhat Thursday and trading was again light across the credit market.""It's just indicative of a lack of confidence, of people really not know what is going on,"" said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm that specializes in high-yield debt. ""So they react quickly to good or bad news.""During the recent boom in credit, banks and brokerage firms lent large sums to hedge funds and other investors who drove down the premium on risky assets like bonds backed by subprime mortgages that are made to people with tarnished credit histories and those taking on excessive debt.Now as defaults on those loans are rising, banks and brokerages are demanding that fund managers come up with more collateral to back up margin loans or sell assets. Investors in these funds are also clamoring to redeem their shares in the funds.""Its like popcorn in a kettle, first you have one or two pops,"" said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund based in New York, ""then it turns into a cacophony.""Most experts believe the nation's mortgage problems will likely worsen in the coming months as hundreds of billions in adjustable-rate loans reset to higher rates in the next 12-to-18 months. At the end of March, nearly one in five subprime home loans were either past due or in foreclosure.At his press conference this morning, Bush said he does not support granting U.S. government funds to distressed homeowners who are on the verge of losing their homes, but he said the Federal Housing Administration should have flexibility to help borrowers refinance their home loans.He also said he felt ""there needs to be more transparency in financial documents"" so that borrowers ""know what they're signing up for.""The market appeared to react positively to remarks by Bush that the administration would not favor changing the way partners in private equity firms are taxed. In recent months, several prominent lawmakers have proposed subjecting the investment gains of fund managers — known as ""carried interest"" — to the ordinary income tax rate of up to 35 percent, rather than the capital gains rate of 15 percent.Noting that partnerships are a common structure among small businesses, Bush said he was satisfied with the current tax structure. ""We are very, very hesitant about trying to target one aspect of limited partnerships,"" he said, ""for fear of it affecting small business growth.""Carried interest has come under criticism because it has allowed managers of private equity firms and hedge funds to pay very little in taxes on income they derive largely from managing their investors' assets rather than putting their own capital at risk."
3,"WASHINGTON —President George W. Bush, seeking to reassure Americans about the economy and combat Democratic criticism of his policies, said that recent financial market turbulence was not a cause for worry but a natural adjustment from the improvident lending of recent years.Speaking Wednesday at the Treasury Department, with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. sitting across the table and reporters seated in a circle around them, Bush said that his economic advisers would be ""paying close attention as the market begins to readjust its assessment of risk"" in housing and other sectors.It was an unusual presentation for Bush, both politically and economically. Presidents are usually advised not to wade into discussions of markets at a time when they are so unpredictable and anxiety-inducing.Bush's suggestion that the recent housing declines should be seen as a normal market correction from past excesses and that the government should avoid interfering with the process carries political risks at a time when people are losing their homes, lending institutions are shaky and Democrats are demanding action.Indeed, immediately after the president's comments, Democrats excoriated him for saying that the economy was in sound shape. Many called on the administration to encourage federal housing agencies to step in and make more money available, perhaps by buying up troubled mortgages to avoid foreclosures.For his part, Bush, in a verbal tour of the current economic scene, was eager to both calm the markets and bat down the Democratic calls for the administration to intervene, predicting that the turmoil in the housing sector would end with a ""soft landing"" and would not damage the larger economy.""I believe that markets ultimately look at the fundamentals of any economy,"" Bush said. ""And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Inflation is down. Real wages are increasing. The job market is a strong job market. People are working. Small businesses are flourishing.""Bush, who has a Harvard MBA, confidently used phrases like liquidity, risk assessment and market adjustment to describe complex economic conditions.Asked about collapsing housing markets, and the risk of them declining further, Bush said: ""In a way it's a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market in the past couple years."" That was financial jargon for the past several years of easy money, some of it from overseas, at low interest rates.Bush said that ""housing got really hot"" as a result of the deep pools of money available and that a decline was inevitable. He added that ""if the market functions normally"" it will lead to a soft landing. ""That's kind of what it looks like so far,"" he contended.Democrats are reacting to the current situation less philosophically. Several are calling for the two big government-sponsored buyers of mortgages from lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to provide more money for housing by buying more loans and holding them.Senator Charles Schumer, Democrat of New York, who is chairman of the housing subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, said that if these agencies did not act, it would lead to a collapse of the market for sound mortgages, not just the deeply troubled ""subprime"" loans that were sold to new homebuyers and people with less-than-sterling credit.""We need to allow Fannie and Freddie to put more credit into prime lending,"" Schumer said. ""This is favored by most Democrats and a good number of Republicans.""But Bush appeared to resist that idea, saying that the agencies needed to overhaul their own practices in the wake of their accounting scandals before jumping into the current crisis. ""Let's get them reformed first,"" he said.Bush said the housing crisis had occurred in part because borrowers had not read the ""fine print"" on their mortgages. ""There needs to be financial education measures in place,"" he said.Bush's session with economic writers was unscheduled until Wednesday morning, when he was at the Treasury building for an annual meeting with his economic team. Their intent was to plan for issues like the budget, taxes and financial regulation coming up in the autumn.Bush also said he would oppose legislation aimed at punishing China for its economic practices, including its efforts to control the value of its currency to encourage cheaper exports. Expressing the need for the United States to lead the global economy, he called on Democrats to approve recently negotiated trade deals with Peru, Panama, Colombia and South Korea.The Peru and Panama deals had appeared to be on track for passage earlier this year, but Democrats backed off in June. Representative Charles Rangel, Democrat of New York, who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that he now expected the Peru deal to proceed in September.Rangel was in Peru earlier this week and said that Peruvian leaders had committed themselves to several steps to protect worker rights, reassuring him on that subject. ""The Peruvians,"" he said, ""will be doing everything that has to be done for this to be passed.""The president said he had also discussed with Paulson and other cabinet members the possibility of tax changes and regulation reductions aimed at overcoming what some see as a weakening of the competitiveness of U.S. capital markets."

6,"NEW YORK —A few generations ago, savers responded to financial panics with runs on banks, and even healthy institutions could fail if they could not raise enough cash quickly enough.But in the past decade a new financial architecture emerged - one that relied less on banks as intermediaries and more on securities.Mortgages were financed by investments in securities that were supposed to be safe - and were so certified by the bond rating agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's.Now that safety is being questioned, and the modern equivalent of a massive bank run is on. And it appears to be up to the central banks, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, to put in cash to tide the system over until the worries recede.As the subprime crisis spread, some investors have sought to sell securities that financed the wave of lending, and others have had to do so because they needed the cash to repay their own loans.These securities pay relatively low interest rates, and there is no reason to hold them if there is any question about their safety, just as there was no reason to keep deposits in a bank that was facing a run amid rumors about its safety.The result has been a freezing up of markets for many securities that, it turns out, were critical to the free flowing of credit in recent years.""Our current system of levered finance and its related structures may be critically flawed,"" said Bill Gross, the chief investment officer of Pimco, a mutual fund company. ""Nothing within it allows for the hedging of liquidity risk, and that is the problem at the moment.""The basis of the system has been a belief that securities backed by bad credits could be very safe - so long as there were other securities that would suffer the first losses that came from defaults in pools of subprime mortgages, or of loans to highly leveraged companies.So far, none of those highly rated securities have failed to make their interest payments on time, but that fact is not enough to make anyone want to buy them now. The rating agencies have downgraded some securities, and they are tightening their standards for new ratings.Early this week, stock market investors around the world tried to reassure themselves that nothing was really wrong, and financial stocks bounced back after suffering sharp declines last week. Analysts argued that profits remained strong, as was world economic growth.On Tuesday, the Fed declined to lower the federal funds rate - the benchmark U.S. interest rate - saying that despite financial market volatility and a decline in the housing market, ""the economy seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters, supported by solid growth in employment and incomes and a robust global economy.""But that comforting scenario did not help the credit markets to recover, or persuade anyone to buy the newly questioned securities - at least at anything like the prices people had assumed. No one wants to sell the securities at very low prices - and in many cases they have borrowed heavily against them. So the markets have dried up.On Thursday, BNP Paribas, a major French bank, said that it could no longer value three investment funds it managed, whose assets had been invested in highly rated securities that were backed by dubious mortgages.""The complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the U.S. securitization market has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly, regardless of their quality or credit rating,"" the French bank said.Added to the problem is that the questionable securities now are widely owned, and sometimes have been repackaged to form the basis of other securities.Gross compared the problem confronting investors to a game of "" 'Where's Waldo' - Waldo being the bad loans and defaulting subprime paper.""Suddenly, some fear Waldo is everywhere. European banks and funds own paper tied to subprime mortgages, and it is not clear who else does, or how investors will react.""You have to believe that in the hedge fund and mutual fund complexes, there is a decision that is building that says, 'I want to hold some Treasuries to have a cushion if I see redemptions,' "" said Robert Barbera, chief economist of ITG.Banks worried about their own liquidity decided this week to increase their reserves, which they can do by borrowing them from other banks. Loans on such rates rose as a result of the added demand. Both the federal funds rate - the rate on loans of reserves between American banks - and the London interbank offered rate - rose sharply higher Thursday.The Fed, which conducts monetary policy by targeting the federal funds rate - was forced to inject money into the system to bring the rate back down to its targeted level. And the ECB lent almost €100 billion, or $130 million, to European banks.If the current panic is just that - unreasoning fear - then such cash infusions may be able to let the new financial system weather the storm. Money can be lent to those owning the dubious securities, obviating the need for them to sell them. As they eventually turn out to be good, the loans can be repaid and all will be happy.On the other hand, if many of those securities turn out to be as bad as people now fear, some of those loans will not be good, and there may be more financial failures.On Thursday, after falling in Europe and opening sharply lower in the United States, share prices recovered some of their losses by early afternoon. Many stock investors still think all will work out acceptably.But the central banks still confront significant challenges. The new financial system, with its credit expansion through securitization, made it possible for questionable borrowers to keep borrowing at very low rates even as the Fed was tightening.Now, the combination of market reaction and new regulations on mortgage lending have drastically tightened credit on many borrowers.""That is important because it means the decline in the housing market is likely to continue,"" Barbera said.If the American economy does continue to weaken, the Fed may feel forced to reduce interest rates sooner than it had expected, even if that move threatens to hurt the value of the dollar. Prices in the futures market for federal funds show that just a few weeks ago investors thought there would be no Fed easing this year. Now they seem to think such a move is highly likely, and some expect it as early as next month.The new financial system is not the one the Fed was created to deal with, but it is the one it must try to handle."
7,"FRANKFURT —Fears of a credit crisis in Europe deepened Thursday, as a big French bank announced it would close three investment funds, and the European Central Bank injected emergency funds into the market for the first time since the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.BNP Paribas, the large French bank, said it had suspended operations of three funds because the deterioration of the U.S. mortgage market had made it impossible to value their underlying assets. It was the latest in a string of disclosures of losses or potential losses by funds and banks in Germany, France, and the Netherlands. And it confirms that the crisis, which began in the subprime segment of American home-loan market, has spread to the heart of Europe's financial markets.The European Central Bank's intervention, which came after overnight borrowing rates spiked to their highest levels since 2001, was intended to soothe the markets. But analysts said it may have had the opposite effect, stoking fears that the worst of the fallout has yet to be felt in Europe. In the United States, the Federal Reserve also added cash to the market.""What we are seeing is financial contagion in action,"" Peter Dixon, an economist at Commerzbank in London, said.European market indicators fell about 2 percent in reaction to the announcements, while U.S. indexes were down more than 1 percent in late trading.Dixon and other analysts said it was too soon to conclude that Europe faces a systemic crisis because of its exposure to the American mortgage market. But stock markets across Europe plummeted on Thursday, and the mood in financial centers from London to Frankfurt was grim.""Trust was shaken today,"" said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ""Credit depends on trust. If trust disappears, then credit disappears, and you have a systemic issue.""Among the questions haunting investors: How much exposure do European banks have to risky U.S. mortgage loans? And given the steady drip of bad news - sometimes days after the same banks issue confident statements - do they even know their level of exposure?""The banks are getting hit on a number of fronts,"" Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, a research firm in London, said. ""You're seeing devaluation across a number of asset classes, so it's very difficult for them to calculate fair-market value of their assets.""With confidence ebbing, the European Central Bank has abandoned its watch-and-wait stance. In a statement issued Thursday morning, the bank noted, ""there are tensions in the euro money market.""It pumped €94.8 billion, or $130 billion, into the market to ease the overnight borrowing rates, which soared to 4.7 percent, well above the bank's benchmark rate of 4 percent. Hours later, the Federal Reserve followed with two smaller injections of funds into the market.A sudden spike in rates reflects a situation in which more banks are scrambling to borrow than are willing to lend.""Someone must have called them and said 'we need liquidity now,' "" said Erik Nielsen, the chief European economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They did what a central bank is supposed to do.""Still, the bank's extraordinary response - its first since Sept. 12, 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington - deepened the sense that the markets had entered dangerous territory.""The ECB ignited a fear that there is something really bad going on that the markets don't yet know about,"" said Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a fund manager at Artemis Investment Management in London. ""It will take time until investors are sure that this is not the case.""While several big European banks, including Credit Suisse, Société Générale of France, and Deutsche Bank, have recently reported robust profits, the list of European banks with problems is also growing.In the Netherlands, NIBC Holding, an investment bank, said Thursday it lost $189 million on mortgage investments. In Germany, West LB bank disclosed that it has investments in subprime assets.West LB, a major regional lender, insisted it did not face the massive losses that threatened another German bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, which has $24 billion in investments in the mortgage market.The Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, said Thursday that a group of banks had formally committed to taking part in a €3.5 billion rescue of IKB, to be led by the state bank, KfW.But another German fund, this one operated by Sal. Oppenheim, has suspended withdrawals by investors. At least three other German funds have closed - either because of direct exposure to subprime assets, or because of the general deterioration in the credit environment.BNP's announcement, which affected funds with a value of €1.6 billion, was particularly startling because it came a week after the bank's chief executive, Baudouin Prot, said BNP's exposure to subprime woes was ""absolutely negligible.""A spokesman for BNP, Jonathan Mullen, said that was still true, as far as the bank itself was concerned. But he said BNP's fund managers were obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out, or new investors from buying shares in the funds.""It's quite exceptional to suspend funds,"" he said. ""We hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.""About one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans, Mullen said, but those investments were in high quality parts of that market. ""We've seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,"" he said.Mullen said the funds are held by BNP clients and represent just a small fraction of the €600 billion the bank currently has under management.Shares of BNP fell €2.88, or 3.4 percent, to close at €82.57 in Paris.Analysts have said it is difficult to determine the exposure of banks to the subprime market because it is often held through collateralized debt obligations - financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks - and banks often do not disclose their exposure.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, whose analysts follow financial companies, said this month that while exposure to subprime may lead to ""modest losses or slightly lower revenue"" among European banks, it would be ""entirely manageable.""In July, Standard & Poor's, the debt rating agency, cut credit ratings on $6.39 billion of bonds backed by subprime mortgages. Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion of bonds for a possible downgrade.There are plenty of rumors about how many subprime mortgages, and related financial products, ended up on the books of European banks. But there is very little reliable data, analysts said.Still, it is clear that European banks loved the high yields of these investments, at a time when interest rates were low and U.S. housing prices were rising. They also liked that these investments carried high credit ratings, suggesting they would be low risk.""For a lot of investors, that was a seal of approval,"" Adamson of CreditSights said. ""European investors are very ratings-based. That may be more important for Europeans than Americans.""At this point, European officials seem as confused as investors by what is going to happen next. ""It's impossible at this stage to judge how large and how persistent this tightening of credit conditions is likely to be,"" Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Wednesday.Not everyone is running for the exits. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, blamed much of Thursday's angst on rumors about hedge funds in trouble.""We won't be surprised if credit market tensions continue to exist over the near future,"" he said, ""but we remain of the view that issues of the market remain very much limited to a certain part of it.""Likewise, economists were not ready to give up their general optimism about the state of the European economy, which, in several countries, is growing at its fastest pace in years. But Mayer of Deutsche Bank said the risk of a more serious liquidity crunch had increased.This has put the European Central Bank in a delicate situation. Last week, as the crisis was in its early stages, it signaled it would raise rates in September, to 4.25 percent. Now it might be forced to wait.On the other hand, Nielsen of Goldman Sachs said, ""If you asked the ECB what caused this problem, they would 'too easy money for too long.' """

9,"Stocks dropped sharply as soon as trading opened today after a French bank, BNP Paribas, suspended operations of three of its funds in the wake of turmoil in the American market for home loans and the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve injected cash into the financial system because of tightening credit markets.The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 200 points, or 1.5 percent, while the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index were down just as much. Stocks remained volatile through the morning, and at 11:40 a.m., the Dow was down about 140 points, or 1 percent. The S.&P. 500 was off by about 1.2 percent, while the Nasdaq was down about 0.5 percent.Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy, President Bush said, “The fundamentals of our economy are strong,” adding, “I’m told there is enough liquidity to enable the system to correct.”The market appeared to react positively to remarks by Mr. Bush that the administration would not favor changing the way partners in private equity firms are taxed. In recent months, several prominent lawmakers have proposed subjecting the investment gains of fund managers  known as “carried interest”  to the ordinary income tax rate of up to 35 percent, rather than the capital gains rate of 15 percent.Noting that partnerships are a common structure among small businesses, Mr. Bush said he was satisfied with the current tax structure. “We are very, very hesitant about trying to target one aspect of limited partnerships,” he said, “for fear of it affecting small business growth.”Carried interest has come under criticism because it has allowed managers of private equity firms and hedge funds to pay very little in taxes on income they derive largely from managing their investors’ assets rather than putting their own capital at risk.The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses.A German central bank meeting was under way to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending.Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares in the funds.“It’s quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can’t buy in or sell out of the funds,” Mr. Mullen said. “But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.”Mr. Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans but that those investments were in high quality parts of that market. “We’ve seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,” Mr. Mullen said. “This is just a technical problem about liquidity.”With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to inject cash into the financial system, and the Federal Reserve added $24 billion in temporary reserves to the United States banking system.A key question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, BNP’s chief executive, Baudouin Prot, said the bank’s exposure to subprime woes was “absolutely negligible.”BNP shares fell more than 5 percent in early trading, but Mr. Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represent just a fraction, or 1.6 billion euros, of the 600 billion euros the bank currently has under management.Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine the exposure of banks to the United States subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.Standard & Poor’s, the debt rating agency, in July cut credit ratings on $6.39 billion of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.Concern among investors about possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped on Aug. 1 even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms, fearing losses from leveraged loans they have underwritten but cannot sell on to investors.Analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, said earlier this month that while exposures to subprime may lead to “modest losses or slightly lower revenue” among European banks  but that would be “entirely manageable.”"
10,"Turmoil in the home loan market ricocheted from the United States to Europe and back again yesterday as stocks on Wall Street suffered their biggest one-day decline since February, reflecting growing concerns about tightening credit worldwide.Big losses on packages of American home loan securities sold to investors turned up unexpectedly in French and Dutch banks yesterday, adding to worries at hedge funds and financial institutions around the globe. With trillions of dollars of securities outstanding, those announcements raised expectations that more problems may soon emerge in other unlikely places as well.The spreading fears forced the European Central Bank and, later, the Federal Reserve to inject billions of dollars into the financial system to help prevent borrowing and lending in credit markets from freezing up.Japan’s central bank followed suit, injecting more than $8 billion into money markets as stocks there plummeted Friday morning. Indexes fell more than 2 percent across Asia in early trading Friday, and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific index, a key regional index, was down 2.9 percent by midmorning in Tokyo.In a statement that could further fuel the selloff, Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said after the United States market closed that the debt markets were “experiencing unprecedented disruptions” that could hurt its profits and financial health. The company said it planned to hold more loans on its own books because investors were not willing to buy them. But it noted that its capacity to do so was “not unlimited.”Yesterday’s sell-off started in France, after BNP Paribas, the largest publicly traded bank there, suspended investors’ ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities. The bank said it had become temporarily unable to place a value on the funds, which have turned sour as increasing numbers of homeowners have defaulted on their loans.“Trust was shaken today,” said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. “Credit depends on trust. If trust disappears, then credit disappears, and you have a systemic issue.”On Wall Street, where shares have been fluctuating wildly in recent weeks, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell nearly 3 percent, and the Dow Jones industrial average fell 387.18 points, or 2.8 percent. European markets were down somewhat less, but stocks in Latin America fell as much or more than they did in New York. Treasury prices edged up as investors sought the safety of holding government debt.For the second consecutive day, President Bush sought to soothe investors by pointing out that the American job market and the global economy were healthy. He added that deep pools of capital were available.“The fundamentals of our economy are strong,” he said at a news conference. “Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system. And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.”But his remarks appeared to have only a brief and limited impact on the stock market. Later in the day, several Democrats criticized the administration’s response to the mortgage problems as weak and shortsighted.BNP became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to American home loans. Late last month, a group of German government-backed banks agreed to bail out a bank based in Düsseldorf, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that invested in riskier American mortgage securities. And yesterday, in the Netherlands, NIBC Holdings reported that it lost at least $188 million on investments in the American mortgage market for subprime loans. Problems have also cropped up at hedge funds and banks in Australia.The spreading fallout and the difficulty of evaluating the value of mortgage securities has made banks and brokerage firms much more wary of lending to clients like hedge funds — and yesterday even to each other.Citing “tensions in the euro money market,” the European Central Bank in Frankfurt lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent to tamp down a surge in the rates banks charge each other for very short-term loans. The Federal Reserve injected $24 billion into the United States banking system to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent, after it opened this morning at 5.5 percent.While officials at the Fed have made it clear that they do not want to simply bail out investors who made unwise investments by quickly cutting interest rates, they are under growing pressure to act. In the futures market, traders went from predicting that an interest rate cut was unlikely next month to forecasting that it was all but certain by September.It is common for central banks to step in to stabilize rates when banks are either pumping too much or too little money into the markets. What was unusual about yesterday’s action was the size of the move in overnight lending rates and the speed with which the central banks acted to bring them under control.“There is certainly a liquidity crisis in the financial system that the normal players themselves are having a little bit of difficulty working out,” said Jane L. Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond firm in Burlington, Vt.But the European bank’s extraordinary response — its first since Sept. 12, 2001, the day after the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington — deepened investors’ anxiety.“The E.C.B. ignited a fear that there is something really bad going on that the markets don’t yet know about,” said Jacob de Tusch-Lec, a fund manager at Artemis Investment Management in London. “It will take time until investors are sure that this is not the case.”In Washington, there were calls for a more direct effort to support the housing market. Democrats argued that the administration should raise limits on the investment activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgages created by the federal government.Daniel H. Mudd, the chief executive at Fannie Mae, said in an appearance on CNBC that his company was “ready to start investing now,” but added that it was “not going to be the only savior out there.”Earlier in the day, Mr. Bush rebuffed the idea of letting Fannie and Freddie sidestep agreements both companies signed with their regulator to limit their portfolios while they address accounting problems. “Congress needs to get them reformed, get them streamlined, get them focused, and then I will consider other options,” he said.Christopher J. Dodd, the Democratic presidential candidate and chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said: “There is no reason why such reform is a necessary precondition to a modification of the cap that is done in a safe and sound manner.”The two huge government-sponsored home mortgage buyers have often divided Washington along partisan lines. Many Democrats view them as important players in advancing affordable housing. But they are looked at with greater skepticism by the Bush administration and some Republicans who argue that the two companies are so big that they could destabilize the financial markets if they stumble.The problems that are plaguing the mortgage market appear to be loosely connected to Fannie and Freddie, however. Most of the loans that are starting to go bad were made by lenders that emerged in the last 10 years with the help of financing from Wall Street.Banks and brokerage firms provided the money to both mortgage companies that made home loans and the hedge funds and other investors that bought securities backed by mortgages. Now as defaults on those loans are rising, trading in the securities that are underpinned by them has seized up.Hedge fund managers are being told by their lenders to pony up more money or collateral to back up their falling investments. And some rich individuals, pension funds and endowments that invested in hedge funds are clamoring to redeem their shares in the funds.“It’s like popcorn in a kettle,” said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund in New York. “First you have one or two pops, then it turns into a cacophony. I think we are about halfway through.”Many experts say the nation’s mortgage problems are likely to worsen in the coming months as hundreds of billions in adjustable-rate loans reset to higher rates in the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of March, nearly one in five subprime home loans were either past due or in foreclosure.At BNP, the three funds with stakes in home mortgages had a combined value of 1.6 billion euros ($2.18 billion), a fraction of the 600 billion euros the bank has under management. A spokesman for the bank, Jonathan Mullen, said fund managers were obliged to halt redemptions, because they could not determine the price of securities.“We hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back,” Mr. Mullen said.The most unnerving aspect of the current situation, analysts and policy makers acknowledge is not knowing how broad and deep the problems run and what kind of impact new revelations will have on the broader market for credit.“It’s impossible at this stage to judge how large and how persistent this tightening of credit conditions is likely to be,” Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, said on Wednesday.Not everyone is running for the exits. Andrew Milligan, head of global strategy at Standard Life Investments in Edinburgh, sid much of yesterday’s angst came from rumors about hedge funds in trouble.“We remain of the view that issues of the market remain very much limited to a certain part of it,” he said.In the American stock market, the Dow average ended the day at 13,270.68, which is still up 6.5 percent for the year. It was the biggest one-day decline since the Dow lost 416.02 points on Feb. 27, another day when stocks sold off around the world.The S.& P. 500-stock index closed at 1,453.09 and is up 2.5 percent for the year. The Nasdaq composite index was down 2.2 percent for the day, to 2,556.49. Treasury prices were up, with the 10-year note rising 18/32, to 99 27/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.77 percent, from 4.85 percent Wednesday.Following are the results of yesterday’s Treasury auction of 30-year bonds:"
11,"The global stock and bond markets these days seem to be playing a giant game of hide and seek.In this version, played on a global field, investors are scrambling to discover which banks, hedge funds or public companies are holding potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans and subprime-related mortgage securities that are imploding.On any given day, traders are exchanging rumors of a hedge fund that has blown up or a Wall Street brokerage firm that has incurred losses in subprime or other mortgage-related securities, creating a frenzy and a whipsaw of trading activity in the stock and bond markets.So far, most rumors have turned out to be unsubstantiated and untrue. Still, exposure to and losses from subprime and other mortgage-related securities are being revealed, slowly, in all corners of the world.Yesterday France’s largest bank, BNP Paribas, stopped withdrawals from three of its asset-backed securities funds, saying it could no longer value them accurately because of problems in the subprime market in the United States.Also yesterday, the insurance giant American International Group revealed that it held $28.7 billion in subprime securities, but that given its size, it was not under any pressure to sell the securities at a loss.Already the turmoil in the mortgage market has led Germany’s government-owned KfW development bank to bail out a bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, that held subprime investments. Several hedge funds in the United States, four in Australia and at least four additional funds in Europe have either closed or halted investor withdrawals as they sort out the value of their subprime and other mortgage-related investments.In reaction to the growing losses on subprime mortgages and related securities, the European Central Bank stepped in yesterday morning and provided $130.2 billion in emergency loans to European banks while the Federal Reserve injected $24 billion in liquidity into the United States banking system.Capital markets have undergone periods of extreme turmoil and lack of liquidity in the past. In 1998, the credit markets virtually froze up after the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management buckled and Russia defaulted on its debts. Many investors dumped mortgage securities into the market and prices tumbled.Yet, the nervousness seems more intense given the amount of leverage, or borrowed money, that had been made available to hedge fund investors in the subprime and mortgage arena. The use of borrowed money, along with the sheer size of the mortgage market, should only worsen investor losses.“This is a market that has grown tremendously in the last five years,” said Professor Stijn Van Nieuwerburgh of the Stern School of Business at New York University, “and whereas a lot of the mortgages were previously held by banks, now, particularly with subprime mortgages, they are held by a lot of new players who are essentially just getting used to them.”Last year, Wall Street firms issued $773 billion in mortgage-related securities, up from $217 billion in 2001, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association.Yet trying to ferret out which one of these relatively new players will be the next to report big losses on subprime or mortgage-related securities, whether they be an Asian bank or American hedge fund, is difficult.Unlike investors who hold large stakes in publicly traded American stocks, and must report those holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, no central government agency or private organization tracks who may be holding subprime or other mortgage-related securities in any detail. (The United States Treasury does track broad foreign country holdings of American mortgage securities.)“I don’t think any of the regulators have a handle on where the net exposure of subprime is,” said Christopher Whalen, managing director of Institutional Risk Analytics, which builds risk systems for regulators and auditors.Mr. Whalen said the situation was worse in Europe, where even less public data was available.Furthermore, because of accounting rules, some holders of these mortgage-backed securities do not have to own up to or recognize any losses until they actually sell them.But these days, trying to value certain subprime securities or the more complicated collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s, which are pools of mortgage securities, is difficult as well.Unlike stocks that trade openly on exchanges and whose value can easily be determined at any point of the day, mortgage-related securities and C.D.O.’s change hands behind the scenes via individual bids and offers made on trading desks across Wall Street.And while, typically, billions of dollars of securities can move in and out of these markets with great ease, in recent weeks trading in mortgage-related has seized up because Wall Street firms are reluctant to buy or sell them, many traders and portfolio managers said.Trading in C.D.O.’s has become a “standoff” said James L. Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a New York-based hedge fund.Jokingly, Mr. Melcher said the attitude of some investors in C.D.O.’s seems to be: “I am dancing here. Don’t bother me about this iceberg we have hit.”If there is an upside to the mortgage meltdown, some analysts said, it may be that because these securities are held by so many investors the pain will be spread among many market participants instead of taking down a large single financial institution.Indeed, two rating agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, said this week that the large American investment banks face modest risks and manageable losses because of subprime-mortgage losses.“The good news is that the losses will be widely distributed across the different owners of these pools of securities,” said Stuart A. Gabriel, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at the University of California, Los Angeles.“The bad news,” he said, “is because of the difficulties in valuing these mortgage pools and the high levels of uncertainty and panic that have set into these markets, we have a situation where there is a severe lack of liquidity in the mortgage market and that has created an extremely dangerous situation for our economy and the global economy.”"
12,"PARIS, Aug. 9 — The French bank BNP Paribas suspended operations of three of its funds and the European Central Bank injected cash into the financial system, both in the wake of turmoil in the United States mortgage market.The European Central Bank lent 94.8 billion euros, or $130.1 billion, to meet banks’ needs after demand for cash in the European money markets drove interest rates higher. The central bank, taking such emergency action for the first time since just after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, said it would provide unlimited amounts at 4 percent, its current benchmark rate.The actions initiated a sell-off in European markets that spilled over into the United States.BNP is the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several major companies have already announced losses.A German central bank meeting was under way today to discuss details of a rescue package for the lender IKB Deutsche Industriebank, another victim of exposure to the crisis in subprime lending. Also today, the Dutch lender NIBC Holding said it had lost $189 million on United States mortgage investments.Jonathan Mullen, a spokesman for BNP, said that the credit squeeze in the United States had made it impossible to calculate the value of the underlying assets of the funds and that the bank was obliged by market conditions to halt holders of the funds from cashing out or new investors from buying shares.“It’s quite exceptional to suspend funds, and it means that people can’t buy in or sell out of the funds,” Mr. Mullen said. “But we hope this is going to be temporary and that the market will come back.”Mr. Mullen said that about one-third of the funds were exposed to subprime loans but that those investments were in high-quality parts of that market. “We’ve seen no degradation in the quality of these assets, none of which have been put on watch for a downgrade,” he said. “This is just a technical problem about liquidity.”A crucial question is whether some European lenders know the full extent of their exposure to the subprime lending crisis. Only last week, Baudouin Prot, the chief executive of BNP, said the bank’s exposure to subprime woes was “absolutely negligible.”BNP shares were down more than 5 percent in afternoon trading in Paris, but Mr. Mullen reiterated that the bank itself had almost no exposure to the subprime crisis. He said the funds are held by BNP clients and represented just a fraction, about 1.6 billion euros of the 600 billion euros the bank has under management.Some analysts have said it is difficult to determine banks’ exposure to the United States subprime market because they are often held through collateralized debt obligations, financial products that bundle securities and help spread risks, and banks often do not disclose their exposure.The debt-rating agency Standard & Poor’s cut credit ratings in July on $6.39 billion worth of bonds backed by subprime mortgages.Fitch Ratings said it was reviewing $7.1 billion, including 19 collateralized debt obligations, for a possible downgrade.Concern among investors about the possible effects of subprime investments and recent woes in the credit markets have outweighed rising earnings at European banks last month.Shares of Deutsche Bank and BNP dropped last week, even though both reported better-than-expected profit in the first half. Investors are reducing their exposure to banks with large investment banking arms."
13,"LONDON —U.S. subprime market tremors spreading to Europe are the first big test of whether European regulators can manage such a crisis.The central question is whether regulation and accounting rules on the Continent require companies to disclose sufficient information to investors about their exposure to such high-risk assets.In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission is reportedly examining financial statements at Wall Street securities firms, including Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch, to make sure they are not hiding subprime-related losses.The top European regulators, many of whom were on vacation and unreachable during the traditional August break, seemed far less concerned.In the absence of any inquiries by a European regulator or any reliable source providing a figure of how many U. S. subprime loans have been purchased by foreigners, investors are being left fully in the hands of the financial institutions.""There is no comprehensive data which allows anybody to know how much Europeans have purchased,"" said Gilles Moec of Bank of America in London. ""It's a problem.""A spokeswoman for Britain's Financial Services Authority said the regulator was ""closely observing market developments and has a constant dialogue with firms"" but that it does so on a regular basis and that there is no need to for any further investigations.In Italy, the stock market regulator is not particularly concerned because there is no subprime market in the country and the banks are not very exposed to the market in the United States, a spokesman said.The French Autorité des Marchés Financiers is paying ""very close attention to the situation"" after BNP Paribas, one of the largest banks in France, suspended investors' ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities. ""We aim to ensure that there is equal treatment of investors and have sought assurances from banks that any suspension of funds will only be provisional.""The Spanish market watchdog, the CNMV, said it could not comment Friday on whether it was examining any funds. Repeated calls Friday to the press office of the German financial market regulator, BaFin, went unanswered.Most European banks and insurance companies use their quarterly earnings reports to inform investors about their exposure to subprime loans. But that did little to calm investors on Friday, when market indicators across Europe fell between 1 percent and nearly 4 percent.And last week, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group just days after saying the bank would not be affected by the U.S. subprime meltdown.German state prosecutors on Friday said they were investigating whether officials at IKB had committed breach of trust or violated German securities law.Geoffrey Wood, a professor of Economics at Cass Business School in London, said that European banks may have been happier to take on risks because the temptation in Europe to bail out banks in trouble is higher. ""Under the U.S. regulatory system there is much less temptation to bail out banks,"" he said.Problems linked to American home loan securities have cropped up at a handful of European banks this month, forcing them to either announce lower earnings or close funds to temporarily halt withdrawals.Accounting rules in Europe offer few assurances to investors trying to avoid companies indirectly or directly exposed to subprime loans.International Financial Accounting Standards, which are similar to those in the United States, started to apply in 2005 but with a lack of a European financial regulator, not all European countries have implemented them similarly and their enforcement varies.The accounting rules do help identify direct investments in subprime lending but when it comes to assets held via a fund or indirectly through collateralized debt obligations, the system is less transparent.Companies are obliged to disclose total assets under management and the revenue they generate from managing them but additional information, for instance what the funds invest in, only needs to be supplied to the investors of those funds and not to shareholders. That is because such investments are ""off-balance sheet,"" meaning the risk of losses at an investment fund lies with its investors and not with the financial services firm that manages it.But the current liquidity crisis has even put to test the valuation methods of assets under management, some analysts said. ""When liquidity is disappearing, the valuations can change very quickly,"" said Iain Coke, head of the financial services faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in London. ""The challenge in the accounting is measuring the values of assets and liabilities under stress.""Any disclosures as required by current accounting standards at the moment, would tell investors very little about what happens in their funds right now, he said, adding that ""maybe we need to look at those rules again.""Noticing a possible shortcoming of required disclosure, some European banks have started to go out of their way to provide information about any possible exposure to the subprime meltdown."
14,"SINGAPORE —Central banks around Asia joined efforts in the U.S. and Europe to stave off a credit crunch among banks Friday, as widening fears over losses in the U.S. housing loan market prompted investors to sell assets and commercial banks to reel in credit lines.Market declines in Europe and New York Thursday sparked a similar rout Friday in Asia. Stocks in Japan, Hong Kong and Australia dropped by more than 2.5 percent, with South Korea's benchmark dropping 4.27 percent. As investors sold off assets considered relatively risky, such as Philippine stocks, they bought those considered safer, such as Japanese government bonds. Asian currencies such as the Thai baht also retreated against the U.S. dollar and more liquid and stable currencies such as the Japanese yen.""Everyone's been talking about a credit crunch and not surprisingly it turned into one,"" said Jan Lambregts, head of Asia research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. While Asian banks didn't seem to be directly affected, he said, ""the main problem is we don't know who is bearing the losses and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we're in right now.""The steep declines, the third such slide since late last month, have begun to raise concerns that deteriorating credit in the United States, rising inflation and higher interest rates are finally starting to end a long period of easy money in global markets.This liquidity bubble, as economists and analysts refer to it, has been a boon to Asia and other emerging markets, allowing governments to pay down debts, pumping up companies with capital and helping to reduce poverty levels. But economists have also worried that it left many of the world's savers exposed to some of the world's riskiest assets, and that dramatic losses were bound to ensue.The losses in Asia on Friday were paced by financial stocks with direct exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage market, which lends money to people with poor credit records. Exporters also fell on concern that the situation might force up U.S. interest rates and hurt consumer demand.The declines were touched off by news that France's largest publicly owned bank, BNP Paribas, was freezing $2.2 billion from three funds with exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages because panic selling had made it impossible to value their holdings. Its move only seemed to heighten the market's alarm, however, prompting the European Central Bank to announce that it had lent out a record $130.6 billion to banks and would continue to provide as much cash as needed as the frenzy of trading pushed up the rate they charge each other to its highest since 2004.Banks, worried that their peers may face subprime exposure or be forced to follow BNP's example, have been cutting back on their credit lines to other banks around the world.Concerns were exacerbated after the U.S. subprime mortgage lender NovaStar Financial announced Thursday that rising defaults had resulted in a $52.9 million second-quarter loss. The Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its worst decline since February, falling roughly 3 percent, with brokerage shares experiencing their worst declines since 2002.Fears of a funding shortage on the part of banks meeting asset-selling investors' demands for funds prompted the Federal Reserve to add $24 billion in reserves to the banking system.Responding to fears of a similar credit squeeze in Asia, the Bank of Japan said it had added 1 trillion yen, or $8.4 billion, to money markets in Tokyo. The Reserve Bank of Australia said it had lent banks 4.95 billion Australian dollars, or $4.2 billion, its biggest such injection of liquidity since 2003.The quandary faced by central bankers was illustrated nowhere better than in South Korea. After raising interest rates on Thursday in an attempt to discourage excessive lending by bankers, Korean central bankers on Friday were reportedly attending crisis meetings on how to handle fears of a liquidity crunch.Still, many analysts and executives remained sanguine that the subprime mess posed no deeper threat to the global economy or financial system.American International Group on Thursday sought to calm investors by saying that despite its own exposure to subprime loans, the U.S. housing market would have to decline by 30 percent or 40 percent, to Depression-era levels, before it would suffer significant losses.Economists in Asia have said that the region's outlook remains positive despite the problems in the United States, though there are concerns that if the downturn in the mortgage market and tightening credit affects consumers, it could hurt Asia's exporters.More immediately, however, they said companies didn't face a cash crunch because of the sudden pullback by bankers. Most companies, they said, had used the ample liquidity of the last few years to reduce their debts and improve their balance sheets.But analysts said concerns still abounded that more losses could spring up as banks, hedge funds and companies examine their exposure to the subprime market. Fears were also mounting that tightening credit in response to losses in the subprime market would begin to spill over into better-rated loans.Stock in Australia's Macquarie Bank, for example, dropped Friday as investors punished it for its highly leveraged investment approach. One of the bank's funds recently announced that it had lost 4 percent of its value even though it had no direct exposure to the U.S. subprime market."
15,"PARIS —Moving to quell fears of a burgeoning financial crisis, the world's major central banks injected billions of dollars into the global banking system Friday, helping Wall Street recover from steep losses after panic trading drove European and Asian markets sharply lower.In a statement that highlighted the depth of the crisis, the Federal Reserve said it would do all it could to ""facilitate the orderly functioning of financial markets.""The central bank said it had added $19 billion in temporary funds to the system, a day after adding $24 billion, to keep its key interest rate close to the 5.25 percent it has targeted. The Fed's announcements, part of what has become a worldwide effort to dispel fears that loaning money was becoming too risky, also appeared aimed at dispelling sentiment that it might need to consider cutting interest rates as early as September to suppress any liquidity crisis. The rate has been at 5.25 percent since June 2006 following 17 consecutive rate hikes.The move came just hours after the European Central Bank pumped billions of euros into the banking system for a second straight day, and the Bank of Japan said it had added $8.4 billion as the global sell-off in securities swept across the Pacific.""The U.S. subprime crisis is no longer a localized event but a source of global financial market contagion,"" said Lena Komileva, an economist at Tullet Prebon in London.""Everyone's been talking about a credit crunch, and not surprisingly it turned into one,"" said Jan Lambregts, the head of Asia research at Rabobank in Hong Kong. ""The main problem is we don't know who is bearing the losses, and that kind of uncertainty is creating the situation that we're in right now.""Uncertainty over the scope of the crisis in the U.S. market for subprime loans pushed stock markets in Asia and Europe sharply lower. The Japanese benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell 2.3 percent, while stocks fell by more than 3.7 percent in Australia. In Europe, bourses in Paris and London closed down more than 3 percent.All three major American indexes fell immediately after the opening bell, and at one point the Dow Jones industrial average was down nearly 200 points, or 1.5 percent. By noon, stocks were on the rebound following the Fed announcement, and the major indexes were briefly in positive territory.In a further sign that the mortgage market problems are more widespread than first thought, Countrywide Financial, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said Friday that it faced ""unprecedented disruptions."" A day earlier, news that BNP Paribas, the large French bank, was freezing $2.2 billion held in three funds with exposure to U.S. subprime mortgages sparked concerns that the risk was spreading well beyond America's shores.The chief worry among investors is that the meltdown in some corners of the credit markets will lead to a broader economic slowdown. Economists say the effects of the crisis will oblige central bankers to remain poised to intervene in the days, and perhaps weeks, to come.""It looks like the ECB will have to stay visible in the market for some time,"" said Komileva. She noted that one-week and one-month lending rates had failed to come down as well, ""which indicates there is still no confidence that that relief can be sustained.""Komileva praised the ECB for stepping in, but wondered if its failure to communicate its intentions before acting may have served to confirm investors' fears of a wider crisis, rather than calm them. ""The actual effect should have been positive,"" Komileva said. ""But the ECB's unexpected intervention has now increased fears that a short-term technical discomfort in the market could be the reflection of greater systemic risk,"" she said.Indeed, the long period of easy money in global markets, or the liquidity bubble as it is referred to by economists and analysts, has been a boon across the globe and in emerging markets, allowing governments to pay down debt and pumping up companies with capital.In Europe, most economists appeared sanguine about the region's capacity to ride out the storm without suffering a downturn, largely because of rapid action by the bloc's central bank. But they warned of areas of potential weakness.Gilles Moëc and Holger Schmieding, economists with Bank of America in London, said highly leveraged industries like the Spanish construction sector, which has done much to buoy the Spanish economy in recent years, were among those that were vulnerable to a slowdown.Moëc and Schmieding also underlined that some banks and hedge funds might have suffered significant losses, especially if they took on heavy debt levels, but the economists said that such losses ""would probably damage their market value rather than their usual operational capabilities.""The rating agency Standard & Poor's also downplayed the risks to the financial sector Friday, saying that ""the resilience of the European banking sector is generally strong enough in our opinion to weather the current environment.""In Germany, however, questions are already looming over the behavior of officials at the state-controlled bank IKB Deutsche Industriebank as the crisis unfolded. State prosecutors said Friday they were investigating possible breaches of trust or violations of German securities law at IKB, which issued a surprise profit warning last week and may suffer billions of euros in losses linked to problems with subprime mortgages."

18,"SYDNEY —As the subprime credit quake ripples through global markets, investors are asking how banks that rely on large quantities of debt to finance acquisitions will stand up to higher interest rates and a market more wary of lending.Over the past few years, Macquarie Bank of Australia has stood out among financial institutions for its heavy reliance on debt to finance high-profile purchases and rapid growth.Macquarie was one of the first financial institutions to recognize the attraction of infrastructure as a long-term asset. The bank has successfully bid for long-term leases on bridges, road systems, airports and power stations, many in the United States. It has then repackaged the assets and sold them to one of the specialty funds it manages, which then sold fund shares to investors. Macquarie takes a cut at each stage.The model has delivered strong returns so far: The investment bank started in 1991 with 53 million Australian dollars, or $45 million at current exchange rates, and now has 35 funds managing more than 220 billion dollars worth of assets.But its reliance on large quantities of debt has prompted questions about the bank's strategy among investors who have become more wary since the collapse of the subprime mortgage market.Macquarie Fortress Investments Fund, which invests in debt instruments, unsettled financial markets last week when it warned investors it had lost 4 percent of its value, even though it had no direct exposure to the subprime market.The bank's share price has also had a roller-coaster ride, at one point falling to almost 29 percent below its all-time high in May before recovering some of the lost ground.Ivor Ries, an analyst with the brokerage firm E. L. & C. Baillieu, based in Melbourne, said the decline was expected. ""Macquarie was on a price-earnings ratio of 20 times when Wall Street was on 12,"" he said. ""The valuations got completely out of kilter with reality.""The problems with the Fortress fund were the latest in a series of setbacks that have caused investors to question whether Macquarie's run might be coming to an end.Earlier this year, the bank was a prominent member of a consortium that tried to take over the iconic Australian airline, Qantas Airways. The deal crashed in a blaze of publicity, and Macquarie was caught in the backlash.Mark Johnson, a co-founder of Macquarie Bank who was until his retirement this year its deputy chairman, said that mistakes were made in the bid for Qantas, but that the bank had learned and would move on.""There were lessons to be learned in handling politically exposed assets and assets where people have emotional attachment to the brand,"" he said.Johnson said that uncertainties troubling the credit markets could cause some short-term problems. But he said a more rigorous credit environment could benefit Macquarie. In his first interview since leaving the company, he said the markets' new risk aversion would be reflected in lower prices being paid to asset owners.""There may be a slowdown in activity because sellers can't get the prices they expect, but they'll adjust to that fairly quickly,"" he said.He said that he did not expect a long-term slowdown in the deal flow, and that the bank was well equipped to take on the increasing competition in the infrastructure market.""Macquarie is in areas they know and understand: it is mainly infrastructure, and there is an established track record and a depth of expertise,"" he said.He added that the bank was expanding into fields, like elder-care homes, that have a similar investment profile to more easily recognizable infrastructure assets.Ries, the brokerage analyst, said that there was no shortage of more traditional assets with conservative balance sheets still waiting to come to market. ""There's another five to 10 years of low-hanging fruit out there,"" he said.Johnson said that, when compared with the bank's full-service competitors, Macquarie was in a relatively strong position. ""If there are tough credit conditions, they only apply in this one field. Macquarie doesn't have any junk bond or debt underwriting exposure,"" he said.The bank says that because its model is to buy and hold assets, it is less susceptible to the vagaries of the market, because it is unlikely to be forced to sell in an unfavorable climate.But if most observers expect Macquarie to ride out the short-term buffeting of the credit markets, many are troubled by questions about the longer-term viability of the model.Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates, who has made its name betting against stock market monoliths like Enron, has suggested that Macquarie shares be sold.""This only works in a world of cheap credit and asset inflation,"" he told a group of investors in May, adding that he believed the model was ""an inherently unstable platform.""Many critics have highlighted the policy of some Macquarie funds of borrowing to pay dividends. The bank said it was aware of the concerns.""The key question is cash, and you can be sufficiently certain of cash flows that you will be able to repay your debts as well as make distributions,"" said Johnson, who remains nonexecutive chairman of the huge Macquarie Infrastructure Group fund.The bank said the average borrowing across all the funds in the investment banking division, which accounts for the most prominent vehicles, is 58 percent of asset value.Part of the problem is the extreme complexity of the securities that Macquarie creates to hold the assets.""It's driven by tax: they create these convoluted structures to take all the free cash flow out of the business and give it to the owner of the asset,"" Ries, of Baillieu, said.Mark Johnson is confident the Macquarie model will survive.""In the foreseeable future, the sectors where Macquarie is competing are going to remain high-growth, and there is so much liquidity in the world that it's hard to see generally favorable conditions changing in the next several years,"" he said."
19,"SINGAPORE —Central banks around Asia began adding cash to money markets Friday in an effort to stave off a credit crunch among lenders, and the European Central Bank injected funds into the banking system for a second straight day, as widening fears over losses in the U.S. housing loan market prompted investors to sell assets and commercial banks to reel in credit lines.Market declines in Europe and New York on Thursday sparked a similar rout Friday in Asia.

20,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Renaissance Institutional Equities Fund, a $26 billion-plus hedge fund managed by mathematician James Simons, is down ""in the order of 7 percent"" for the year through Aug. 8, according to a letter the fund sent to investors Thursday.Renaissance, one of the largest ""quantitative"" hedge funds, told investors that it has ""not had good luck during these last few days."" It said it has been ""caught in what appears to be a large wave of de-leveraging on the part of quantitative long-short hedge funds.""Results for the past two trading days since the letter went out early Aug. 9 could not be obtained.It also said results for July were ""quite disappointing,"" with returns down between 4 percent and 4.5 percent, according to the letter that was obtained by Reuters.Renaissance is a pioneer in the use of mathematical models that rapidly trade stocks in a strategy that is backed by debt, or leverage.Simons' success in his other fund, Medallion, has made him among the highest paid managers in the $1.7 trillion industry, taking home an estimated $1.7 billion in 2006. Both funds are part of Renaissance Technologies Corp., based in East Setauket, New York.Other major quantitative funds, AQR Capital Management, D.E. Shaw & Co., Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) Global Alpha, and Tykhe Capital have also suffered in the recent market downdraft prompted by a widening crisis in the subprime-mortgage lending market, sources briefed on the matter told Reuters.""All the quant managers are having trouble now, because their models are based on past events, and we haven't seen markets exactly like these before,"" said Brad Alford, a portfolio manager at Alpha Capital Management in Atlanta, whose clients' investments include hedge funds.Simons said both the markets and his systems were behind the declining returns for Renaissance Institutional Equity, but he said he expects the fund to recover.""While much of the damage was due to weak markets, our system experienced meaningful relative losses during the first two weeks of the month,"" said Simons in the letter.But he said the fund is ""in the final stages of release"" for three ""very promising new signals,"" or components to trading models, that should help the fund ""ultimately produce attractive rewards.""Renaissance declined to comment."
21,"Aug. 10 (Bloomberg) -- Prices of goods imported into the U.S. rose more than forecast in July on higher oil costs, highlighting Federal Reserve concerns that inflation may not subside.The 1.5 percent increase, the biggest since March, followed a revised 0.9 percent gain in June, the Labor Department reported today in Washington. Prices excluding petroleum rose 0.2 percent, the fifth straight rise, after climbing 0.1 percent.Higher raw-material costs and a weaker dollar are pushing up prices for goods from all over the world, including China and Latin America. Rising prices from abroad make it more difficult for the Fed to lower rates should the economy stumble following the global retreat in financial markets.""There clearly are inflationary pressures in this report -- we see them both in energy and outside of energy,"" said Julia Coronado, a senior economist at Barclays (NYSE:BCS) Capital in New York. ""It highlights the balance the Fed is trying to strike"" in the midst of the market turmoil.U.S. Treasury securities briefly trimmed gains following the report before heading higher on concerns the subprime mortgage crisis in the U.S. was spreading abroad. The yield on the 10-year note was 4.73 percent at 8:49 a.m. in New York compared with 4.77 late yesterday. Stock index futures were down.ForecastsEconomists forecast import prices would rise 1 percent for a second month, according to the median of 51 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Forecasts ranged from a gain of 0.2 percent to 2.3 percent.The import-price index is the first of three monthly price gauges. The Labor Department's report on wholesale prices is due Aug. 14 and the consumer price index on Aug. 15. Economists forecast consumer prices rose 0.2 percent in July for a second month, according to a Bloomberg survey.Compared with a year earlier, prices of imported goods rose 2.8 percent in July after a 2 percent gain in June. Excluding petroleum, prices also increased 2.8 percent in the past 12 months.The price of imported petroleum jumped 7 percent in July, the most since March. Prices were up 4.1 percent from the same time a year earlier.Food Costs JumpFood and beverage prices climbed 1.6 percent and were up 9.8 percent in the 12 months ended July, the biggest year- over-year gain since 1995.The Fed this week kept the benchmark interest rate at 5.25 percent and acknowledged that inflation excluding food and energy appeared to be slowing.""Readings on core inflation have improved modestly in recent months,"" the Federal Open Market Committee said in its Aug. 7 announcement. Still, the committee reiterated that the ""predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected.""A decline in the value of the dollar is making imports more expensive and, in turn, lowering the cost of American- made goods to overseas buyers. The dollar has fallen more than 7 percent since the beginning of last year against a trade-weighted basket of currencies of major U.S. trading partners.The cost of imported capital goods increased 0.2 percent for a second month. Prices of imported automobiles, parts and engines rose 0.1 percent. Costs for imported consumer goods excluding autos increased 0.1 percent.China, Latin AmericaPrices of goods from China and other countries in the Pacific Rim increased 0.4 percent, the biggest jump since records began in 2003. Goods from Latin America cost 3.6 percent more, the biggest increase since April 2006.Strong growth in Europe and Asia is also allowing companies to raise prices globally. Arnhem, Netherlands- based Akzo Nobel NV (NASDAQ:AKZOY) , the world's biggest maker of paints and coatings, said earnings rose in the second quarter after increased demand for chemicals allowed the company to push up prices by an average 3 percent.""The key factor is to stay amongst the leaders in our industry, because if you have scale you can pass on price increases to your customers,"" Chief Executive Officer Hans Wijers said July 24.Price CutsEven as the dollar falls, a slowing U.S. economy has prompted some companies to lower prices.Toyota Motor Corp. (NYSE:TM) is cutting prices of its vehicles sold in the U.S. to gain market share as consumer spending cools. Toyota's incentives on its Tundra pickup truck jumped to an estimated $6,861 per vehicle, the highest level of spending for any full-size pickup, according to Edmunds.com.Bob Carter, head of U.S. sales for the Toyota brand, said conditions in California and the entire West Coast have become ""challenging,"" in part because of falling home values.Prices of U.S. exports rose 0.2 percent after rising 0.3 percent in June. Prices of farm exports jumped 1.5 percent, while those of non-farm exports were unchanged."

23,"LONDON, Aug. 10  As subprime market tremors in the United States spread to Europe, they are raising questions whether regulation and accounting rules on the Continent are forcing companies to disclose enough information to investors about their exposure to such high-risk assets.While regulators in the United States are reportedly examining financial statements of Wall Street securities firms to make sure they are not hiding subprime-related losses, regulators in Europe seem far less concerned.A spokeswoman for the Financial Services Authority in Britain said on Friday that the agency was “closely observing market developments and has a constant dialogue with firms” but added that it did that regularly and there was no need to make further investigations.In Italy, the stock market regulator is not particularly concerned, a spokesman said, because there is no subprime market in the country and the banks are not much exposed to the American market.The Authorité des Marchés Financiers in France is paying “very close attention to the situation” since BNP Paribas, the largest publicly traded bank there, suspended investors’ ability to remove money from three funds that had invested in American mortgage securities.“We aim to ensure that there is equal treatment of investors,” the agency said in a statement, “and have sought assurances from banks that any suspension of funds will only be provisional.”The Spanish market watchdog, the Comisión Nacional del Mercado de Valores, or CNMV, said that it could not comment Friday on whether it was examining any funds.Repeated calls to the media office of the German financial market regulator, known as BaFin, were not answered.In the absence of any inquiries by a European regulator or any reliable source providing a figure of how many subprime loans have been purchased by foreigners, investors are being left in the hands of the financial institutions.“There is no comprehensive data which allows anybody to know how much Europeans have purchased,” Gilles Moëc of Bank of America in London said. “It’s a problem.”Most European banks and insurance companies have used their quarterly earnings reports to inform investors about their exposure to subprime loans but that did little to calm investors, especially after an episode last week involving IKBDeutsche Industriebank.The German bank had disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group just days after the bank said it would not be affected by mortgage losses in the United States.German state prosecutors said Friday that they were investigating whether officials at IKB might have committed breach of trust or violated German securities law.Geoffrey Wood, a professor of economics at Cass Business School in London, said that European banks might have been more willing to take on risks because the tendency to bail out banks in trouble is stronger in Europe.“Under the U.S. regulatory system,” he said, “there is much less temptation to bail out banks.”Problems linked to American home loan securities have cropped up at several European banks this month, forcing them to either announce lower earnings or close funds temporarily to halt withdrawals.Accounting rules in Europe are offering little help to investors trying to avoid companies indirectly or directly exposed to subprime loans. International Financial Accounting Standards, which are similar to those in the United States, started to apply in 2005 but since Europe lacks an overall financial regulator, not all countries have put the rules in place in the same manner, and enforcement varies.The accounting rules do help identify direct investments in subprime lending. But when it comes to assets held via a fund or indirectly through collateralized debt obligations, the system is less transparent.Companies are obliged to disclose total assets under management and the revenue they generate from managing them, but additional information, for instance what the funds invest in, needs to be supplied only to the investors of those funds and not to shareholders. That is because such investments are “off-balance sheet,” meaning the risk of losses at an investment fund lies with its investors and not with the financial services firm that manages it.But the current liquidity crisis has begun to test the valuation methods of assets under management, some analysts said. “When liquidity is disappearing, the valuations can change very quickly,” said Iain Coke, head of the financial services faculty at the Institute of Chartered Accountants in London. “The challenge in the accounting is measuring the values of assets and liabilities under stress.”Any disclosures required by current accounting standards would tell investors very little about what happens in their funds right now, he said, adding that “maybe we need to look at those rules again.”Noticing a possible shortcoming of required disclosure, some European banks have started to go out of their way to provide information about any possible exposure to the subprime problems. On Friday, the KBC Group, Belgium’s second-biggest financial services company, after Fortis, went so far as to run through some “extreme stress tests” with its portfolio as part of its earnings presentation.“In times when there is uncertainty and fear, disclosure is a good thing,” said Andy Lynch, a fund manager at Schroder Investment Management in London."
24,"NEW YORK —Should the Federal Reserve help bail out billionaire hedge fund managers and millionaire traders - the very people who bought the risky mortgages that led to the current market panic?That, in essence, is the question swirling around Ben S. Bernanke as he confronts the first crisis of his 18 months as Fed chairman.There are no shortages of opinions, and some are being shouted. Jim Cramer, known for his histrionics on the CNBC financial news channel, angrily called for Bernanke to lower interest rates, something the Fed has resisted doing.A week ago, Cramer charged that the Fed was ""asleep"" and that the chairman ""has no idea how bad it is out there"" in the markets. A video clip of his remarks has been viewed more than 1 million times on YouTube.Lower interest rates would help operators of hedge funds and other money managers because the housing market presumably would strengthen as mortgage rates fell. A revived mortgage market would give hedge fund operators and other holders of the risky securities a chance to sell them, which they are having trouble doing in the current panic.But others see a bigger danger for the economy in acting on the pleas of Cramer and others on Wall Street. Cutting interest rates to help the hedge funds would tend to encourage a resurgence of the very risky mortgage lending that has caused the turmoil.The issue is often referred to as ""moral hazard,"" meaning that the risk-takers who brought on this panic would feel bailed out and would be more likely do it again - just as a young adult whose parents paid off a large credit card bill might feel free to run up a debt again.""The argument is, people did risky things,"" said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They are getting punished now, and if you ease interest rates, you reduce the punishment.""Bernanke sees the issue in a more pragmatic way. The Fed's actions and words suggest that, far from concerning himself with moral hazard, the chairman is attempting to protect reassure ordinary stockholders and bondholders.By pumping a total of $62 billion on Thursday and Friday into the pool of funds available for lending, small investors can continue to trade securities, confident that the checks they receive from their brokers will not bounce. This new liquidity allows the banks to provide credit to the marketplace without driving up interest rates.Short-term rates, in fact, had spiked because of the panic, and the Fed's action brought the key rate that it controls back to the 5.25 percent level that the Fed considers about right to keep the economy growing while minimizing the risk of higher inflation and, eventually, a slowing economy.""The first line of defense for dealing with a liquidity problem is to make sure the system has enough reserves, so there can be an adequate amount of lending,"" said Brian Sack, an economist at Macro Economic Advisers.The next line of defense, if the market panic were to persist and threaten a recession, would be to cut interest rates. Cramer and some others on Wall Street want Bernanke to do that now.Bernanke has kept the federal funds rate steady for more than a year, arguing as recently as this week that the economy is reasonably strong and that cutting interest rates might drive up inflation. ""The predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected,"" the Fed said in a statement after its last policy meeting, on Tuesday.Still, if the panic persists and the economy begins to suffer, Bernanke would presumably be forced to rely on the only other tool the Fed has - a rate cut. His training, and the books and scholarly papers he has written, suggest he would be reluctant to do that.His background suggests a different way of thinking, one in which market panics should be dealt with not by cutting interest rates but focusing on short-term liquidity.For all the turmoil in the markets this week, the people most immediately affected are the hedge funds, banks and mortgage companies that most aggressively traded, invested in and sold subprime mortgages. The people involved are mostly the nation's wealthiest. Hedge funds, for example, require investors to have a net worth of at least $5 million.""It is a limited crisis as of now,"" said Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist. ""And if I had to bet my life, I would bet that it would remain that way. But I would not want to bet my life."""
25,"When an investment banker set out to buy a $1.5 million home on Long Island last month, his mortgage broker quoted an interest rate of 8 percent. Three days later, when the buyer said he would take the loan, the mortgage banker had bad news: the new rate was 13 percent.“I have been in the business 20 years and I have never seen” such a big swing in interest rates, said the broker, Bob Moulton, president of the Americana Mortgage Group in Manhasset, N.Y.“There is a lot of fear in the markets,” he added. “When there is fear, people have a tendency to overreact.”The investment banker’s problem was that he was taking out a so-called jumbo mortgage — a loan greater than the $417,000 mortgage that can be sold to the federally chartered enterprises, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The market for large mortgages has suddenly dried up.For months after problems appeared in the subprime mortgage market — loans to customers with less-than-sterling credit — government officials and others voiced confidence that the problem could be contained to such loans. But now it has spread to other kinds of mortgages, and credit markets and stock markets around the world are showing the effects.Those with poor credit, whether companies or individuals, are finding it much harder to borrow, if they can at all. It appears that many homeowners who want to refinance their mortgages — often because their old mortgages are about to require sharply higher monthly payments — will be unable to do so.Some economists are trimming their growth outlook for the this year, fearing that businesses and consumers will curtail spending.“In the last 60 days, we’ve seen a substantial reduction in mortgage availability,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a brokerage firm. “That in turn suggests that home purchases will fall further. Rising home prices were the oil that greased the wheel of this engine of growth, and falling home prices are the sand in the gears that are causing it to grind to a halt.”At the heart of the contagion problem is the combination of complexity and leverage. The securities that financed the rapid expansion of mortgage lending were hard to understand, and some of those who owned them had borrowed so much that even a small drop in value put pressure on them to raise cash.“You find surprising linkages that you never would have expected,” said Richard Bookstaber, a former hedge fund manager and author of a new book, “A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds and the Perils of Financial Innovation.”“What matters is who owns what, who is under pressure to sell, and what else do they own,” he said. People with mortgage securities found they could not sell them, and so they sold other things. “If you can’t sell what you want to sell,” he said, “you sell what you can sell.”He recalled that the crisis that brought down the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 started with Russia’s default on some of its debt. Long-Term Capital had not invested in Russia’s bonds, but some of those who owned such bonds, and needed to raise cash, sold instruments that Long-Term Capital also owned, and on which it had borrowed a lot of money.It appears that in this case, securities backed by subprime mortgages were owned by people who also owned securities backed by leveraged corporate loans. With the market for mortgage paper drying up, and a need to raise cash, they sold the corporate securities and that market began to suffer.The Wall Street investment banker who wanted a jumbo mortgage had a good credit score, and is not a subprime borrower. But private mortgage securities are now hard to sell, leading to his problem. In the end, he was able to get a mortgage with a lower interest rate, but it will adjust in five years, possibly to a much higher level.The size of the rate increase he faced is unusual. But all jumbo lenders have raised rates. Bankrate.com reports that conventional 30-year mortgages cost about 6.23 percent now, less than they did a few weeks ago, due to a decline in Treasury bond rates. But the average jumbo rate is now 6.94 percent. The spread between the two rates rose from less than a quarter of a percentage point to more than two-thirds of a point.Jumbo mortgages are most important in areas with high home prices, most notably on the East and West coasts. “In California, it has shut down the purchase market,” said Jeff Jaye, a mortgage broker in the Bay area. “It has shut down the refi market.”The problems with subprime mortgages erupted as home prices began to slip in some markets, making it harder to refinance mortgages. There were reports that a surprisingly large number of loans made in 2006 were defaulting only months after the loans were made.Many of those mortgages had been financed by securities, highly rated by credit agencies, that suddenly seemed less secure than they had. Hedge funds that owned those securities, and had borrowed against them, were asked to put up more money to secure their loans.Two Bear Stearns hedge funds were forced to liquidate, and investors lost everything. Investors shied away from buying new mortgage securities, and several lenders went out of business, unable to finance the mortgage loans they had promised to make.With the credit gears clogged, there has been a sudden lust for cash at many levels of the financial system. Last week banks in Europe and the United States tried to borrow so much money that central banks had to step in to keep interest rates from rising.“What I suspect is that there is a demand for credit by institutions that don’t want to sell the securities they own, because the bids are so low, and the banks are extending credit to them,” said William L. Silber, a professor of economics and finance at New York University and the author of the book “When Washington Shut Down Wall Street: The Great Financial Crisis of 1914 and the Origins of America’s Monetary Supremacy.”Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises, can still purchase mortgages and issue securities, guaranteeing that the underlying mortgages will not default. Those guarantees are still accepted by investors, and borrowers who meet their standards — meaning they can get so-called conforming mortgages — still can borrow. But those who want larger mortgages, or cannot make down payments, face a harder burden.Homeowners with adjustable mortgages can refinance them at any time, so long as they qualify for a new loan, so some facing a payment increase may be able to wait it out and refinance later, if the market improves.There have been sudden changes in the mortgage market before, but this one may be both more severe and more damaging than those in the past.In past years most borrowers had 30-year mortgages with fixed rates. If such borrower kept his job, he usually could meet the monthly payments, even if the value of the home had declined so much that he could not et a new mortgage.Now, however, many mortgages call for sharply rising monthly payments after a few years, and borrowers were given loans without regard to their ability to meet the higher payments. Lenders assumed the mortgage could be refinanced, and that rising home prices would assure repayment of the loan. It became common to offer homebuyers loans to finance the entire purchase price of a home.In June, banking regulators ordered that adjustable-rate loans be given only to borrowers who could afford the rate at which it was likely to be reset, meaning that many borrowers would not qualify for refinancings even if their homes had not lost value. Such a rule three years ago might have prevented the crisis, Mr. Barbera said, but imposing it now may worsen the problem.Investors made the mistake of assuming that housing prices would continue to rise, said Dwight M. Jaffee, a real estate finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley. “I can’t believe these sophisticated guys made this mistake,” he said. “But I would remind you that lots of investors bought dot-com stocks.”He added, “When you are an investor, and everybody else is doing the same thing and making money, you often forget to ask the hard question.”And that is how a problem that began with Wall Street excesses that provided easy credit to borrowers — and made it possible for people to pay more for homes — has now turned around and severely damaged the very housing market that it helped for so long."
26,"When all the daily gyrations were done, the major American stock indexes were in positive territory for the week.It was far from a smooth ride, though. The volatility that has recently characterized the American market spread throughout the world. Most major markets declined for the week, even if Wall Street managed a net gain. Central banks in Europe and Japan, as well as the Federal Reserve, injected funds into the financial system.The subprime mortgage crisis was, again, the immediate cause of the volatility. With investors increasingly risk-averse, Treasuries remained in demand. The yield on 10-year Treasuries rose to 4.81 percent, from 4.68 percent the previous week, but remained well below a peak of nearly 5.3 percent in mid-June.For the week, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 57.63 points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 13,239.54. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index climbed 20.59 points, or 1.4 percent, to close at 1,453.65. The Nasdaq composite index rose 33.64 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 2,544.89.JEFF SOMMER"
27,"FOR something that everybody assured us was “contained,” the subprime mortgage mess certainly has spread.Last week, the hemorrhaging credit markets bled right into the stock market. The major indexes are still up for the year, thankfully, but the Dow Jones industrial average, which hit 14,000 just three weeks ago, has lost 5.4 percent of its value since then. And the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index is down 6.4 percent from its July peak.Why are the bond market’s troubles something for stock investors to worry about?The easy answer is that all markets, both here and around the globe, are intertwined. And despite Wall Street’s insistence that diversification — and therefore safety — could be found in different types of assets, investors are again learning that diverse holdings often behave similarly. This is especially true in periods of uncertainty like the one we are enduring now.But there are other reasons that the stock market is getting dinged by bond woes. One involves private equity firms, which provided perhaps the biggest push to stock prices when they paid significant premiums to acquire public companies. If these firms cannot borrow money in the bond market to finance their buyouts, or if they must pay more for those borrowings, their business models do not work as well. And that means the private equity bid for stocks fades away.Even more surprising, to young hedge fund managers at least, is the way the credit crisis has begun to hammer seemingly conservative equity investment funds. This is another explanation for the stock market’s upheaval last week.Using what are known as market-neutral strategies designed by computer models, hedge fund traders have been blindsided by a correlation between bonds and stocks that they never expected would occur.Portfolios of this stripe are often known as quantitative funds; some of their most common trades are called statistical arbitrage. These bets are suggested by brilliant mathematicians and academics, using computer models to scour the markets for interesting trading patterns that continue for long periods.For example, a computer might trace the relationship and trading characteristics of two similar assets, like shares of General Motors and Ford. The fund manager then makes trades, going both long and short, based on the way these shares generally trade. If Ford typically trades cheaper than General Motors, the manager would short Ford and buy G.M., capturing what might be small profits, but on a large volume.Another type of trade might involve stocks’ performance immediately after an analyst downgrade or upgrade. Trades are placed on thousands of stocks to try to capitalize on the “typical” behavior that the computer coughs up.Seeing that such bets typically generated profits over long periods left traders believing that their stakes were conservative.The only trouble is, financial markets do not always trade in a way that is typical or predictable. And when they deviate from the norm, all the wonderful and smart trades stop behaving according to plan.ANALYSTS call it model misbehavior.In a research report from Lehman Brothers last week, Matthew S. Rothman described the phenomenon. Fund managers experiencing losses in their fixed-income portfolios who were unable to sell their positions then tried to unwind the trades they could sell — that is, stocks. They cashed in the shares they had purchased and bought back the ones they had sold short.The result was that stocks that had historically been weaker became stronger, and vice versa.“It is not simply that model returns are flat (or not working),” Mr. Rothman wrote, “but specifically that the models (ours included) are behaving in the opposite way we would predict and have seen and tested for over very long time periods (45-plus years).”As a result, “risk models are miscalibrated for the current market environment,” he wrote.Compounding the problem, of course, is the borrowed money these funds use to enhance their performance. When things start to unravel, leverage aggravates an already painful fall.Mr. Rothman also pointed out that so many fund managers had the same trades on their books that when they went to cash out of them, the ill effects were exaggerated.The losses that investors are suffering this month, he wrote, are comparable only to those in the 1960s and during the bursting of the Internet bubble. “This appears to be an event with little precedent,” he wrote.None of this would be a problem, of course, if fund managers were not relying so heavily on just that — precedent — to make their decisions. Computer models seem so perfect, so scientific, so flawless, and they are advertised to investors in precisely that fashion. Ingenious models lull investors into a dangerous complacency about the risks they are taking. It is almost as if the models eliminate risk entirely from the markets.But risk is never gone, as investors are recognizing with a jolt. And that is so even if Wall Street assigns conservative-sounding labels to portfolio strategies that are, in fact, aggressive.“They have their standard deviations, correlations, ‘stable value’ and ‘real return’ funds and nothing for what the normal human being would call risk at all,” said Frederick E. Rowe Jr., a money manager at Greenbrier Partners in Dallas. “They’ve taken the word ‘risk’ and hijacked it. The concept of risk — the permanent loss of capital — vanished in the minds of the people who speak the new language.”Risk, and all that it should connote to investors, is back in the language now. Unfortunately, it has brought an awful lot of losses with it."
28,"THE job of an economist, among many other duties, is to put things into perspective. So, because I am an economist, among other duties, here is a little perspective on the recent turmoil in the stock and bond markets.First, when the story of this turbulence is reported, the usual explanation mainly has to do with some new loss in the subprime mortgage world — the universe of mortgages and mortgage-backed instruments related to buyers with poor credit histories or none at all.Here is the first instance in which proportion tells us that something is out of whack:The total mortgage market in the United States is roughly $10.4 trillion. Of that, a little over 13 percent, or about $1.35 trillion, is subprime — certainly a large sum. Of this, nearly 14 percent is delinquent, meaning late in payment or in foreclosure. Of this amount, about 5 percent is actually in foreclosure, or about $67 billion. Of this amount, according to my friends in real estate, at least about half will be recovered in foreclosure. So now we are down to losses of about $33 billion to $34 billion.The rate of loss in subprime mortgages keeps climbing. In time, perhaps it will double, maybe back to $67 billion. This is a large sum by absolute standards, and I would sure like to have it in my bank account.But by the metrics of a large economy, it is nothing. The total wealth of the United States is about $70 trillion. The value of the stocks listed in the United States is very roughly $15 trillion to $20 trillion. The bond market is even larger.Much more to the point, the fears and terrors about subprime mortgages have helped knock off 6.7 percent of the stock market’s value in recent weeks. This amounts to about $1.1 trillion, or more than 30 times the losses so far in the subprime market. In other words, these subprime losses are wildly out of all proportion to the likely damage to the economy from the subprime problems.The disconnect goes even further. The Dow Jones industrial average has been heavily moved by fears about the subprime market. But how are most of the Dow 30 affected by subprime mortgages in any meaningful way? No Dow company is short of liquidity, and consumer spending is still strong.Foreign stocks, especially in developing countries, have been hard hit, and this is supposedly connected with a “repricing of risk,” which in turn is connected with subprime mortgages. But how are the risks in Thailand or Brazil or Indonesia intrinsically related to problems in a housing tract in Las Vegas? The developing countries are fantastically strong and liquid. Why should problems at a mortgage company in Long Island have anything to do with them?European stocks have also been hard hit, and this has to do with relatively small amounts of subprime in some European banks. On a global scale, the numbers in Germany and France are minuscule for subprime exposure. For European markets to fall on subprime issues makes no sense.News last Thursday that a small amount of unpriceable subprime mortgages was in a BNP Paribas fund in France sent the markets in Europe and the United States sharply lower. Why? The losses in France are at most in the single billions, while the losses in United States markets alone were in the hundreds of billions on the BNP news.Then there is the supposed “drying up” of credit for private equity deals because of fears of risk. But this is also puzzling. I can’t think of a single recent major private equity deal in which the bonds have defaulted.More to the point, suppose that all private equity deals were stalled for a year. Why should this affect the Dow? None of companies in the Dow 30 is having trouble raising cash. And suppose that all private equity deals went away for good. Taken together, they are not all that big a piece of the United States economy. Why should they put the markets of the richest nation in the world, as well as all of the world’s other markets, into turmoil?Then let’s take a peek at Bear Stearns. This venerable and clever financial house has taken some major hits on subprime mortgages lately. That is sad for the stockholders (I am a very small stockholder), and the price of Bear Stearns stock has tumbled.A little over a week ago, news about Bear Stearns’ liquidity issues lowered the its market value by about more than $1 billion in one day. That is a big hit to a single company, to be sure, but then came the shocker: that news also helped wipe out hundreds of billions off the total value of United States stocks.MY point is this: I don’t know where the bottom is on subprime. I don’t know how bad the problems are at Bear. Yet I do know that the market reactions are wildly out of proportion to the real problems that have been revealed. Maybe there is some giant thing hiding in the closet that might rationalize the market’s fears. But if it’s hidden, how can the market be reacting to it in the first place?More will be revealed, as the saying goes. But recently, investors have been selling out of all relation to what we know. Reassurances in word and deed from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped calm the markets on Friday. But recent events are a disturbing commentary on the power of fear.This economy is extremely strong. Profits are superb. The world economy is exploding with growth. To be sure, terrible problems lurk in the future: a slow-motion dollar crisis, huge Medicare deficits and energy shortages. But for now, the sell-off seems extreme, not to say nutty.Some smart, brave people will make a fortune buying in these days, and then we’ll all wonder what the scare was about."

But the numbers in Germany and France are minuscule for subprime exposure. For European markets to fall on subprime issues makes no sense.News last Thursday that a small amount of unpriceable subprime mortgages were in a BNP Paribas fund in France sent the markets in Europe and the United States lower by hundreds of billions of dollars. Why? The losses in France are at most in the billions, not the hundreds of billions.Then there is the supposed ""drying up"" of credit for private equity deals because of fears of risk. But this is also puzzling. I can't think of a single recent major private equity deal in which the bonds have defaulted.More to the point, suppose that all private equity deals were stalled for a year. Why would this affect the Dow? None of companies in the Dow 30 are having trouble raising cash. And suppose that all private equity deals went away for good. Taken together, they are not all that big a piece of the U.S. economy. Why should they put the markets of the richest nation in the world, as well as all of the world's other markets, into turmoil?Then let's take a peek at Bear Stearns. This venerable and clever financial house has taken some major hits on subprime mortgages lately. That is sad for the stockholders (I am a very small stockholder), and the price of Bear Stearns stock has tumbled.A little over a week ago, news about Bear Stearns's liquidity issues lowered the market value of the company by about $1.2 billion. That is a big hit to a single company, to be sure, but then came the shocker: that news also helped wipe hundreds of billions of dollars off the total value of U.S. stocks.My point is this: I don't know where the bottom is on subprime. I don't know how bad the problems are at Bear. Yet I do know that the market reactions are wildly out of proportion to the real problems that have been revealed or even hinted at. Maybe there is some giant thing hiding in the closet that might rationalize the market's fears.But if it's hidden, how can the market be reacting to it in the first place?More will be revealed, as the saying goes. But recently, investors have been selling out of all relation to what we know. Reassurances in word and deed from Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, helped calm the markets Friday. But recent events are a disturbing commentary on the power of fear.This economy is extremely strong. Profits are superb. The world economy is exploding with growth. To be sure, terrible problems lurk in the future: a slow-motion dollar crisis, huge Medicare deficits and energy shortages. But for now, the sell-off seems extreme, not to say nutty.Some smart, brave people will make a fortune buying in these days, and then we'll all wonder what the scare was about.Ben Stein is a lawyer, writer, actor and economist.

30,"Should the U.S. Federal Reserve help bail out billionaire hedge fund managers and millionaire traders - the very people who bought the risky mortgages that led to the current market panic?That, in essence, is the question swirling around Ben Bernanke as he confronts the first crisis of his 18 months as Fed chairman.There are no shortages of opinions, and some are being shouted. Jim Cramer, known for his histrionics on the CNBC financial news channel, angrily called for Bernanke to lower interest rates, something the Fed has resisted doing.A week ago, Cramer charged that the Fed was ""asleep"" and that the chairman ""has no idea how bad it is out there"" in the markets. A video clip of his remarks has been viewed more than a million times on YouTube.Lower interest rates would help operators of hedge funds and other money managers because the housing market, presumably, would strengthen as mortgage rates fell. A revived mortgage market would give hedge fund operators and other holders of the risky securities a chance to sell them, which they are having trouble doing in the current panic.But others see a bigger danger for the economy in acting on the pleas of Cramer and others on Wall Street. Cutting interest rates to help the hedge funds would tend to encourage a resurgence of the very risky mortgage lending that has caused the turmoil.The issue is often referred to as ""moral hazard,"" meaning that the risk-takers who brought on this panic would feel bailed out and would be more likely do it again - just as a young adult whose parents paid off a large credit card bill might feel free to run up a debt again.""The argument is, people did risky things,"" said Jan Hatzius, chief domestic economist at Goldman Sachs. ""They are getting punished now, and if you ease interest rates, you reduce the punishment.""Bernanke sees the issue in a more pragmatic way. The Fed's actions and words suggest that, far from concerning himself with moral hazard, the chairman is attempting to protect and reassure ordinary stockholders and bondholders.Pumping a total of $59 billion on Thursday and Friday into the pool of funds available for lending meant small investors could continue to trade securities, confident that the checks they receive from their brokers would not bounce. This new liquidity allows the banks to provide credit to the marketplace without driving up interest rates.Short-term rates, in fact, had spiked because of the panic, and the Fed's action brought the key rate that it controls back to the 5.25 percent level that the Fed considers about right to keep the economy growing while minimizing the risk of higher inflation and, eventually, a slowing economy.""The first line of defense for dealing with a liquidity problem is to make sure the system has enough reserves, so there can be an adequate amount of lending,"" said Brian Sack, an economist at Macro Economic Advisers.The next line of defense, if the market panic were to persist and threaten a recession, would be to cut interest rates. Cramer and some others on Wall Street want Bernanke to do that now.Bernanke has kept the federal funds rate steady for more than a year, arguing as recently as last week that the economy is reasonably strong and that cutting interest rates might drive up inflation. ""The predominant policy concern remains the risk that inflation will fail to moderate as expected,"" the Fed said in a statement after its last policy meeting, on Tuesday.Still, if the panic persists and the economy begins to suffer, Bernanke would presumably be forced to rely on the only other tool the Fed has - a rate cut. His training, and the books and scholarly papers he has written, suggest he would be reluctant to do that.His background suggests a different way of thinking, one in which market panics should be dealt with not by cutting interest rates but by focusing on short-term liquidity.For all the turmoil in the markets this week, the people most immediately affected are the hedge funds, banks and mortgage companies that most aggressively traded, invested in and sold subprime mortgages. The people involved are mostly the nation's wealthiest. Hedge funds, for example, require investors to have a net worth of at least $5 million.""It is a limited crisis as of now,"" said Albert Wojnilower, a Wall Street economist. ""And if I had to bet my life, I would bet that it would remain that way. But I would not want to bet my life."""
31,"NEW YORK —When an investment banker set out in July to buy a $1.5 million home on Long Island, his mortgage broker quoted an interest rate of 8 percent. Three days later, when the buyer said he would take the loan, the mortgage banker had bad news: the new rate was 13 percent.""I have been in the business 20 years, and I have never seen"" such a big swing in interest rates, said the broker, Bob Moulton, president of the Americana Mortgage Group in Manhasset, New York. ""There is a lot of fear in the markets. When there is fear, people have a tendency to overreact.""The buyer's problem was that he was taking out a so-called jumbo mortgage - a loan greater than the $417,000 mortgage that can be sold to the federally chartered enterprises, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.The market for large mortgages has suddenly dried up.For months after problems appeared in the market for subprime mortgages - loans to customers with less-than-sterling credit - government officials and others voiced confidence that the problem could be limited to such loans. But now it has burst into other kinds of mortgages, and credit markets and stock markets around the world are showing the effects.Those with poor credit, whether companies or individuals, are now finding it much harder to borrow, if they can at all. It appears that many homeowners who want to refinance their mortgages - often because their old mortgages are about to require sharply higher monthly payments - will be unable to do so.Some economists are trimming their growth outlook for the this year, fearing that businesses and consumers will curtail spending.""In the last 60 days, we've seen a substantial reduction in mortgage availability,"" said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG, a brokerage firm. ""That in turn suggests that home purchases will fall further. Rising home prices were the oil that greased the wheel of this engine of growth, and falling home prices are the sand in the gears that are causing it to grind to a halt.""At the heart of the contagion problem is the combination of complexity and leverage. The securities that financed the rapid expansion of mortgage lending were hard to understand, and some of the investors who owned them had borrowed so much that even a small drop in value put pressure on them to raise cash.""You find surprising linkages that you never would have expected,"" said Richard Bookstaber, a former hedge fund manager and author of a new book, ""A Demon of Our Own Design: Markets, Hedge Funds and the Perils of Financial Innovation.""""What matters is who owns what, who is under pressure to sell, and what else do they own,"" he said. People with mortgage securities found they could not sell them, and so they sold other things. ""If you can't sell what you want to sell,"" he said, ""you sell what you can sell.""He recalled that the crisis that brought down the Long-Term Capital Management hedge fund in 1998 started with Russia's default on some of its debt. Long-Term Capital had not invested in Russian bonds, but some investors who owned such bonds, and needed to raise cash, sold instruments that Long-Term Capital also owned, and on which it had borrowed a lot of money.It appears that in this case, securities backed by subprime mortgages were owned by people who also owned securities backed by leveraged corporate loans. With the market for mortgage paper drying up, and a need to raise cash, they sold the corporate securities, and that market began to suffer.With the credit gears clogged, there has been a sudden lust for cash at many levels of the financial system. Last week, banks in Europe and the United States tried to borrow so much money that central banks had to step in to keep interest rates from rising.""What I suspect is that there is a demand for credit by institutions that don't want to sell the securities they own, because the bids are so low, and the banks are extending credit to them,"" said William Silber, a professor of economics and finance at New York University and the author of the book ""When Washington Shut Down Wall Street: The Great Financial Crisis of 1914 and the Origins of America's Monetary Supremacy.""Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored enterprises, can still purchase mortgages and issue securities, guaranteeing that the underlying mortgages will not default. Those guarantees are still accepted by investors, and borrowers who meet their standards - meaning they can get so-called conforming mortgages - still can borrow. But those who want larger mortgages, or cannot make down payments, face a heavier burden.There have been sudden changes in the mortgage market before, but this one may be both more severe and more damaging than those in the past.In past years, most borrowers had 30-year mortgages with fixed rates. If they kept their jobs, they could meet the monthly payments even if the value of their home had declined so much that they could not get a new mortgage.Now, however, many mortgages call for sharply rising monthly payments after a few years, and borrowers were given loans without regard to their ability to meet the higher payments. Lenders assumed the mortgage could be refinanced, and that rising home prices would assure repayment of the loan. It became common to offer home buyers loans to finance the entire purchase price of a home.In June, banking regulators ordered that adjustable-rate loans be given only to borrowers who could afford the rate at which it was likely to be reset, meaning that many borrowers would not qualify for refinancings even if their homes had not lost value. Such a rule three years ago might have prevented the current crisis, Barbera said, but imposing it now may worsen the problem.Investors made the mistake of assuming that housing prices would continue to rise, said Dwight Jaffee, a real estate finance professor at the University of California, Berkeley. ""I can't believe these sophisticated guys made this mistake,"" he said. ""But I would remind you that lots of investors bought dot-com stocks.""He added, ""When you are an investor, and everybody else is doing the same thing and making money, you often forget to ask the hard question.""And that is how a problem that began with Wall Street excesses that provided easy credit to borrowers - and made it possible for people to pay more for homes - has now turned around and severely damaged the very housing market that it helped for so long."
32,"The wild swings in the stock market over the last few weeks have reawakened memories of the technology crash of 2000 in which many small investors lost their savings. But this time around, market experts say, ordinary investors seem less vulnerable than the professionals who have taken a beating.The excesses in the financial markets are now generally believed to reside in complex mortgage securities and other esoteric investments, not in the traditional stock and bond markets where average Americans put their money.Over all, analysts say that the situation may well get worse before it gets better. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has fallen about 6.4 percent since July 19 when it set a record high. It is considered normal for the market to fall as much as 10 percent periodically during bull markets. That leaves room for the Dow Jones industrial average to fall another 640 points, to 12,600.In the near term, average Americans can expect more turmoil and uncertainty in the stock market and may have a harder time obtaining mortgages. But investment experts say that ordinary long-term investors, as long as they are diversified, should worry less.""There is no immediate crisis"" for the long-term individual investor, said Michael Poulos, a managing director at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm that specializes in financial services. ""This is mostly a case of relatively rich, sophisticated investors who made big bets on the credit spreads that will have big problems. It is not Joe 401(k).""The credit crisis has reverberated throughout the financial markets, but the greatest impact has been felt by investors in mortgage securities and those involved with corporate buyouts. Also, hundreds of thousands of homeowners are facing resetting rates on loans and may not be able to refinance easily into another loan.Last week, the Federal Reserve and other central banks lent $293 billion to banks to ensure that there was enough money to lend to borrowers.But even skeptical market watchers acknowledge that stocks, which average Americans buy through mutual funds, appear less vulnerable than the market for complex debt investments typically bought by hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies. Since bottoming out in late 2002, stocks have risen at a more modest pace than in the 1990s — an average of 13 percent a year. And despite recent losses, the Dow is still up 6.2 percent since Jan. 1.The ratio of stock prices to corporate profits for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index is 16.8, slightly above the average of 15.7 since 1935, but below the average of 22.8 since 1988.On numerous occasions in recent decades, stocks have fallen 6 percent or more in a short period. In most cases — in 1998, 1999 and 2003, for example — stocks began rising again soon. In a few cases, most notably 2000, the initial declines signaled larger problems.There is no way to predict where the market will go, but many investment specialists say the economy is fundamentally strong. Companies are adding jobs and real wages are rising. (On Monday morning, Japanese stocks increased slightly, with the Nikkei 225 index up 0.48 percent at midday.)Still, the fact that the markets in the United States are falling despite a vibrant global economy has been unnerving to individual investors.""How concerned should I be?"" asked Shanna Rendon, a 53-year-old retired lab technician in Grand Junction, Colorado ""I am managing the finances for our retirement — and I don't want to lose money.""She and her husband lost more than $1 million of their retirement nest egg in the crash that followed the boom of the late 1990s.

""Now, I am looking at a country where the economy has a problem because of a lot of credit.

""But the 20-year numbers suggest that this is a return to normal.""Individual investors should figure out how comfortable they are with the risks of their investments, while considering their financial circumstances and investment goals, advisers say.Many financial experts suggest investors consider moving their money to less risky investments like Treasury notes and blue-chip stocks, which they expect to now perform better than junk bonds and smaller stocks.But they caution against impulsively buying and selling stocks based on a short-term market swing. ""None of us are going to be able to time our moves,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""If you take a more systematic approach, then you are sort of putting yourself on the right side of the market. But it's not human nature to do that.

33,"For something that everybody assured us was ""contained,"" the subprime mortgage mess certainly has spread.Last week, the hemorrhaging credit markets bled right into the stock market. The major indexes are still up for the year, thankfully, but the Dow Jones industrial average, which hit 14,000 just three weeks ago, has lost 5.4 percent of its value since then. And the Standard & Poor's 500 is down 6.4 percent from its July peak.Why are the bond market's troubles something stock investors have to worry about?The easy answer is that all the markets, both here and around the globe, are intertwined. And in spite of Wall Street's insistence that diversification - and therefore safety - could be found in different types of assets, investors are once again learning that diverse holdings often behave similarly. This is especially true in periods of uncertainty like the one we are enduring now.But there are other reasons the stock market is getting dinged by bond woes. One involves private equity firms, which provided perhaps the biggest push to stock prices when they paid significant premiums to acquire public companies. If these firms cannot borrow money in the bond market to finance their buyouts, or if they must pay more for those borrowings, their business models do not work as well. And that means the private equity bid for stocks fades away.Even more surprising, to young hedge fund managers at least, is the manner in which the credit crisis has begun to hammer seemingly conservative equity investment funds. This is another explanation for the stock market's weakness last week.Using what are known as market-neutral strategies designed by computer models, hedge fund traders have been blindsided by a correlation between bonds and stocks that they never expected.Portfolios of this stripe are often known as quantitative funds; some of their most common trades are called statistical arbitrage. These bets are suggested by brilliant mathematicians and academics, using computer models to scour the markets for interesting trading patterns that continue for long periods.For example, a computer might trace the relationship and trading characteristics of two similar assets, like shares of General Motors and Ford. The fund manager then makes trades, going both long and short, based on the way these shares generally trade. If Ford typically trades cheaper than General Motors, the manager would short Ford and buy GM, capturing what might be small profits but on a large volume.Another type of trade might involve stocks' performance immediately after an analyst downgrade or upgrade. Trades are placed on thousands of stocks to try to capitalize on the ""typical"" behavior that the computer coughs up.The decades-long history showing that such bets would typically generate profits bestowed on these traders a belief that their stakes were conservative. Only trouble is, financial markets do not always trade in a manner that is typical or predictable. And when they deviate from the norm, all the wonderful and smart trades stop behaving according to plan.Analysts call it model misbehavior. In a research report from Lehman Brothers last week, Matthew Rothman described the phenomenon. Fund managers experiencing losses in their fixed-income portfolios who were unable to sell their positions then tried to unwind the trades they could sell - that is, stocks.They cashed in the shares they had purchased and bought back the ones they had sold short. The result was that stocks that had historically been weaker became stronger and vice versa.""It is not simply that model returns are flat (or not working), but specifically that the models (ours included) are behaving in the opposite way we would predict and have seen and tested for over very long time periods,"" Rothman wrote. As a result, ""risk models are miscalibrated for the current market environment.""Compounding the problem, of course, is the borrowed money these funds use to enhance their performance. When things start to unravel, leverage aggravates an already painful downward fall.Rothman also pointed out that so many fund managers had the same trades on their books when they went to cash out of them that the ill effects were exaggerated.The losses investors are suffering this month, he wrote, are comparable only to those in the 1960s and during the bursting of the Internet bubble. ""This appears to be an event with little precedent,"" he wrote.None of this would be a problem, of course, if fund managers were not relying so heavily on just that - precedent - to make their decisions. Computer models seem so perfect, so scientific, so flawless, and they are advertised to investors in precisely that fashion. Ingenious models lull investors into a dangerous complacency about the risks they are taking. It is almost as if the models eliminate risk entirely from the markets.But risk is never gone, as investors are recognizing with a jolt. And that is so even if Wall Street assigns conservative-sounding labels to portfolio strategies that are, in fact, aggressive.""They have their standard deviations, correlations, 'stable value' and 'real return' funds and nothing for what the normal human being would call risk at all,"" said Frederick Rowe Jr., a money manager at Greenbrier Partners in Dallas. ""They've taken the word 'risk' and hijacked it. The concept of risk - the permanent loss of capital - vanished in the minds of the people who speak the new language.""Risk, and all that it should connote to investors, is back in the language now. Unfortunately, it has brought an awful lot of losses with it."

35,"SINGAPORE, Aug. 13 — If there is a crisis in global financial markets, it wasn’t apparent in Asia today.After Friday’s slide in Asia, some of the region’s biggest markets sprang back today. They were helped by the slight recovery on Wall Street after the close of Asian markets late last Friday.Australia’s benchmark index gained 1.3 percent and South Korea’s main index rose 1.6 percent.Reflecting some of the inverse logic that seems to govern markets of late, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average index rose on news that the country’s economic growth was slowing, and that the central bank had lent an additional $5 billion to banks to ensure adequate funds in the money market.Commodity prices recovered after declining on concerns that hedge funds were selling their positions to cover losses related to the United States subprime mortgage market.It appeared that moves by the world’s most important monetary authorities, the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan, to avert a shortage of cash in global markets had worked for the time being.After the Bank of Japan’s announcement today, the Reserve Bank of Australia and the European Central Bank said they were putting more funds into the market.Last week, concerns about growing losses in the ailing market for subprime mortgages in the United States prompted many investors in Asia to take funds out of any investments that were considered relatively risky, either because they involved emerging markets or because they were tied to high levels of debt.The recovery today encouraged some analysts to sound a note of optimism. They pointed to a growing awareness that Asia is still flush with funds and doesn’t suffer from the same reliance on debt as investors do in Europe and the United States.“The worst of it’s behind us in Asian markets,” said Adrian Mowat, a strategist at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. “Asian monetary systems have been relatively flush with cash and growth here is typically being funded by earnings — household and corporate, rather than debt funding.”Others, however, warned that more surprises could be in store for the region and that today’s recovery might in retrospect be only a temporary respite.“We think the volatility will continue for a while,” said Hans Goetti, head of research strategy at Citi Private Bank in Singapore.There was, therefore, still an air of uncertainty in Asia today, analysts said, with investors selling stocks in some smaller markets and buying stocks in larger economies, especially financial and commodity-related stocks that had been pushed down last week.“As information flows out, people are waiting to see what happens next,” said Rahul Malhotra, managing director for private banking in the Middle East and Pacific Rim at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.Merrill’s advice to its clients, Mr. Malhotra said, was not to join the panic selling, advice he said that most appeared to be taking.Indeed, some analysts said the latest declines provided an opportunity to buy Asian stocks more cheaply.“I like these types of events because the market overreacts,” said Mr. Mowat. ”The comments that come across in the media are overstating what the real impact is.”Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed back part of the way after falling 3.7 percent on Friday, its biggest drop in six years.Traders said moves by the Federal Reserve and by Australia’s Reserve Bank of Australia to ensure adequate liquidity restored confidence among investors.The Australian dollar climbed higher after the Reserve Bank raised its outlook for inflation, increasing the likelihood that it would raise interest rates.Because metals are Australia’s largest export, the Australian dollar also tends to move with commodity prices.Prices for oil and copper rose today amid signs of growing Chinese demand and falling global stockpiles.The Bank of Japan said today that it had lent banks an additional 600 billion yen to help ensure adequate funding in the interbank market, after pumping 1 trillion yen into the market on Friday."
36,"If there is a crisis in global financial markets, it was not apparent in Asia and Europe today. And on Wall Street, the week got off to an unremarkable start.Stock prices were up moderately but broadly in the United States for most of the day, with little of the volatility that had characterized the markets last week. But the major indexes shed their modest gains late in the trading session and finished the day not far from where they closed on Friday.When trading ended, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 3.01 points, at 13,263.53. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500 stock index and the Nasdaq composite were each off 0.1 percent or less.A number of early developments appeared to help put investors at ease today. Before the market opened, the government reported that retail sales rose in July at a solid pace. With mortgage markets tightening and home values dropping in many parts of the country, some economists have questioned whether consumer spending could stand up.Also, Goldman Sachs moved today to shore up one of its hedge funds that has suffered huge losses in the recent market turmoil. The investment bank said it and other investors would add $3 billion to the fund.Separately, the Federal Reserve today added more money into the financial system, providing $2 billion in loans in an effort to help calm the markets.Financial stocks were a drag on the market today. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, closed at $26.61, down 4 percent, and Fannie Mae was off 3.5 percent at $64.12.Technology equipment and telecommunications stocks were among the strongest performers. EMC, the data storage company, was up 7.5 percent to $19.05 ahead ofthe initial public offering of its VMware unit this week.Hewlett-Packard gained 2.6 percent to $48.43, and Sprint Nextel was up 3.4 percent at $19.49.In Europe today, stock indexes in Paris and Frankfurt finished about 2 percent higher, and British stocks were up almost 3 percent.The day’s tone was set in Asia, where some of the region’s biggest markets sprang back today after a slide last Friday. They were helped by the slight recovery in American markets after the close of Asian markets late last Friday.Australia’s benchmark index gained 1.3 percent and South Korea’s main index rose 1.6 percent.Reflecting some of the inverse logic that seems to govern markets of late, Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average index closed slightly higher on news that the country’s economic growth was slowing, and that the central bank had lent an additional $5 billion to banks to ensure adequate funds in the money market.Central banks from Australia to the United States made similar loans today. The European Central Bank added $65.3 billion to the markets today.Last week, concerns about growing losses in the ailing market for subprime mortgages in the United States prompted many investors in Asia to take funds out of any investments that were considered relatively risky, either because they involved emerging markets or because they were tied to high levels of debt.The recovery today encouraged some analysts to sound a note of optimism.

38,"NEW YORK —The wild swings in the stock market over the last few weeks have reawakened memories of the technology crash of 2000 in which many small investors lost their savings. But this time around, market experts say, ordinary investors seem less vulnerable than the professionals who have taken a beating.The excesses in the financial markets are now generally believed to reside in complex mortgage securities and other esoteric investments, not in the traditional stock and bond markets where average investors put their money.Overall, analysts say that the situation may well get worse before it gets better. The Standard & Poor's 500 has fallen about 6.4 percent since July 19, when it set a record high.It is considered normal for the market to fall as much as 10 percent periodically during bull markets. That leaves room for the Dow Jones industrial average to fall another 640 points, to 12,600.In the near term, average investors can expect more turmoil and uncertainty in the stock market and may have a harder time obtaining mortgages, especially in the United States. But investment experts say that ordinary long-term investors, as long as they are diversified, should worry less.""There is no immediate crisis"" for the long-term individual investor, said Michael Poulos, a managing director at Oliver Wyman, a consulting firm that specializes in financial services. ""This is mostly a case of relatively rich, sophisticated investors who made big bets on the credit spreads that will have big problems.""The credit crisis has reverberated throughout the financial markets, but the greatest impact has been felt by investors in mortgage securities and those involved with corporate buyouts.Also, hundreds of thousands of homeowners are facing resetting rates on loans and may not be able to refinance easily into another loan.Last week, the Federal Reserve and other central banks across the globe lent $293 billion to banks to ensure that there was enough money to lend to borrowers.But even skeptical market watchers acknowledge that stocks, which average Americans buy through mutual funds, appear less vulnerable than the market for complex debt investments typically bought by hedge funds, pension funds and insurance companies.Since bottoming out in late 2002, stocks have risen at a more modest pace than in the 1990s - an average of 13 percent a year. And despite recent losses, the Dow is still up 6.2 percent since Jan. 1.The ratio of stock prices to corporate profits for the S & P 500 is 16.8, slightly above the average of 15.7 since 1935, but below the average of 22.8 since 1988.On numerous occasions in recent decades, stocks have fallen 6 percent or more in a short period. In most cases - the summers of 1998 and 1999, and the winter of 2003, for example - stocks began rising again soon. In a few cases, most notably 2000, the initial declines signaled larger problems.There is no way to predict where the market will go, but many investment specialists say the economy is fundamentally strong.Companies are adding jobs and real wages are rising.Still, the fact that the stock and credit markets are falling despite a vibrant global economy has been unnerving to individual investors.In the short term, investors can probably expect more turmoil.Expectations of future volatility - though they are far lower by one popular measure than they were early in this decade and in the late 1990s - have surged to their highest levels in more than four years.""Certainly for young folks, this is a shocker,"" Jim Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investments in Boston, said about volatility. ""But the 20-year numbers suggest that this is a return to normal.""Individual investors should figure out how comfortable they are with the risks of their investments, while considering their financial circumstances and investment goals, advisers say.Many financial experts suggest investors consider moving their money to less risky investments like Treasury notes and blue-chip stocks, which they expect to now perform better than junk bonds and smaller stocks.But they caution against impulsively buying and selling stocks based on a short-term market swing.""None of us are going to be able to time our moves,"" said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Charles Schwab. ""If you take a more systematic approach, then you are sort of putting yourself on the right side of the market. But it's not human nature to do that. We love to ride our winners until something happens.""For now, anxiety is particularly high among well-heeled investors in some hedge funds that have reported losses. Many are flocking for the exits, forcing portfolio managers to sell otherwise solid investments.And the demands could intensify this week: Wednesday marks 45 days before the end of the quarter, the deadline by which most hedge fund investors must notify the funds if they want to redeem their investments.Stock prices could also decline further if investors no longer expect the big premiums that private equity firms have been paying to buy public companies.To place the current period in context, many experts are studying the credit crisis in 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debts and the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management collapsed.""In 1998, 60 subprime companies went out of business,"" said Meredith Whitney, an analyst with CIBC World Markets. ""And that didn't send our economy into a recession.""In fact, the stock market climbed higher after the Fed intervened to save Long-Term Capital and the International Monetary Fund lent money to Russia.Other market watchers, however, contend that employment and profits are often lagging indicators and that the American economy is already slowing, along with growth in consumer spending.As adjustable-rate mortgages are reset, many U.S. homeowners will face higher monthly housing payments. That could force some families to cut back on spending.Sallie Krawcheck, head of global wealth management at Citigroup, said ordinary investors should be ""making adjustments for risk and, if appropriate, exploring possible buying opportunities.""They should focus on whether ""the market volatility bleeds over into the health and behavior of consumer,"" she said. ""That is the key for the real economy.""David Leonhardt contributed reporting."
39,"FRANKFURT —The rest of Europe may be deep into its annual summer hiatus, but the Frankfurt headquarters of the European Central Bank has been a hive of activity since Thursday, when the bank thrust itself into a market rattled by fears of a credit crisis.On Monday, the bank injected €47.7 billion, or $65 billion, into the financial system, its third emergency operation since last week, to keep European money markets from drying up. That came after a landmark injection of €94.8 billion Thursday morning.These bold and costly moves have put a spotlight on the European Central Bank, which has traditionally played a supporting role to the Federal Reserve in global financial crises. This time, the Europeans acted earlier, and on a far larger scale, than either the Fed or central banks in Asia.Some market commentators have accused the central bank of panicking, and said its intervention could send the wrong signal to hedge funds or other institutions engaged in risky investing by suggesting they could expect to be bailed out.Yet its remedy seems to have worked - at least as a short-term measure to prevent the problems in the United States mortgage-lending market from swamping the broader markets in Europe. The Federal Reserve and the central banks of Japan and Australia also injected funds into the market.In a statement Monday, the European Central Bank said ""money market conditions are normalizing.""Several economists said the bank had little choice but to respond on a huge scale after it became clear early Thursday that banks in Europe were unable to obtain credit in a market spooked by the disclosure of European losses from the U.S. subprime market.""Possibly they overdid it,"" said Erik Nielsen, the chief European economist at Goldman Sachs in London. ""But if they had done less, and we had a systemic crisis, they would have been blamed for it.""Nielsen described the bank's intervention as a ""textbook example of what to do when trouble emerges.""To some extent, the European central bank's central role was simply dictated by the clock. The crisis in confidence set off by the mortgage-lending problem reached a critical stage Thursday morning in Europe, hours before the markets opened in the United States.The first players to feel the credit crunch were European banks, seeking to borrow in dollars. The lack of liquidity drove up the overnight borrowing rate to 4.6 percent, well above the bank's benchmark rate of 4 percent.For days, European investors had been unnerved by disclosures that banks and investment funds here faced losses because of exposure to mortgage-related investments. BNP Paribas's announcement on Thursday that it would suspend operations of three funds tipped the market into havoc.""The problem is, these funds looked like normal euro money market funds,"" said Thomas Mayer, the chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ""That led to a loss of trust in the market.""Like the Fed, the ECB keeps in daily touch with officials at commercial banks. Through these contacts, it became aware of the deepening distress in the market. Some observers, including Nielsen, suspect the ECB's top leaders were also warned about the crisis directly from senior executives at major European financial institutions.However the information trickled in, the decision to intervene in the market was made by the bank's executive board, a six-member committee chaired by the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet. Officials at the ECB said Trichet had been closely involved in the recent operations.In a sign of its success, the bank's moves brought the overnight borrowing rate quickly back to 4 percent.""It looks like a very successful operation to stabilize the money market,"" Mayer said. ""The Fed has had slightly more trouble. On Thursday, they injected too little, and on Friday, they overcompensated.""After the European bank's initial injection of €94.8 billion at a rate of 4 percent - its first such intervention since the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks - the subsequent tenders on Friday and Monday represent a type of mopping up, Nielsen said.The bank is essentially rolling over a portion of the loans it issued on Thursday. The fact that it is injecting less each day indicates that it is gradually withdrawing from the market.The big question now is whether the bank will adjust its policy to account for the market mayhem. After its last policy meeting in early August, as the crisis was in an earlier stage, Trichet signaled the bank would raise rates by a quarter point, to 4.25 percent, in September.Whether the bank chooses to put that increase on hold depends on whether markets calm down. On Monday, most European markets were up more than 2 percent. The Bank of England, in its first statement since the crisis began, said it did not plan to inject funds into the system.""The climate of distrust could blow over, with proper central bank action,"" Mayer said. ""What will remain is a more sober calculation of credit risk. When a credit bubble deflates, you hit hard bumps.""Mayer said he doubted the mortgage-related problems would, by themselves, undermine Europe's robust economic performance. Deutsche Bank projects Europe's economy will grow 2.8 percent in 2007, easily outstripping the United States, which is projected to grow 2 percent.But he says that contrary to recent popular belief, a sharp slowdown in the United States would affect Europe.""The good news is that real estate markets do not affect each other,"" Mayer said. ""But as real estate financing tightens up, it affects all real estate markets, not just in the United States."""
40,"SINGAPORE —If there is a crisis in global financial markets, it was not apparent in Asia on Monday.Some of the region's biggest markets sprang back after Friday's slide, with Australia's benchmark index gaining 1.3 percent and South Korea's rising 1.6 percent. Bourses in Europe opened higher, also following Wall Street's stabilization on Friday.Reflecting the perverse logic that governs markets of late, Japan's Nikkei 225 stock average rose on news that the country's economic growth was slowing - suggesting borrowing costs will remain low and friendly to business - and that the central bank had lent an additional $5 billion to banks to ensure they have enough cash.Commodity prices also recovered after declining on concerns that hedge funds were selling their positions to cover losses related to the U.S. subprime mortgage market.All in all, it appeared that moves in recent days by the world's biggest monetary authorities - the Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan - to avert a shortage of cash in global markets by lending money at cheap rates had worked for the time being.The Bank of Japan on Monday announced that it would again put more funds in the market. The Reserve Bank of Australia and the ECB followed suit.Last week, concerns about growing losses in the ailing U.S. market for subprime mortgages to risky borrowers prompted many investors in Asia to yank funds out of any investments considered relatively less safe, either because they involved emerging markets or because they were tied to high levels of debt.The recovery encouraged some analysts to sound a note of optimism Monday. They pointed to a growing awareness that Asia is still flush with funds and does not suffer from the same reliance on debt as investors do in Europe and the United States.""The worst of it's behind us in Asian markets,"" said Adrian Mowat, a strategist at JPMorgan in Hong Kong. ""Asian monetary systems have been relatively flush with cash, and growth here is typically being funded by earnings - household and corporate, rather than debt funding.""Others, however, warned that more surprises could be in store for the region and that Monday's recovery might in retrospect be only a temporary respite. ""We think the volatility will continue for a while,"" said Hans Goetti, head of research strategy at Citi Private Bank in Singapore.There was an air of battening down in Asia on Monday, analysts said, with investors selling stocks in some smaller markets and buying stocks in larger economies, especially financial and commodity-related stocks that had been pushed down last week.""As information flows out, people are waiting to see what happens next,"" said Rahul Malhotra, managing director for private banking in the Middle East and Pacific Rim at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. Merrill's advice to its clients, Malhotra said, was not to join the panic selling, advice he said most appeared to be taking.Indeed, some analysts said the latest declines provided an opportunity to buy Asian stocks more cheaply. ""I like these types of events because the market overreacts,"" said Mowat. ""The comments that come across in the media are overstating what the real impact is.""Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index climbed back part of the way after falling 3.7 percent Friday, its biggest drop in six years, to a three-month low. Traders said moves by the Federal Reserve and by Australia's own Reserve Bank of Australia to ensure adequate liquidity restored confidence among investors.The Australian dollar climbed as well after the Reserve Bank raised its outlook for inflation, increasing the likelihood that it would raise interest rates.Because metals are Australia's largest export, the Australian dollar also tends to move with commodity prices. Prices for oil and copper rose Monday amid signs of growing demand from China and falling global stockpiles.The Australian dollar also climbed against the Japanese yen, following data showing the Japanese economy slowing. Investors interpreted that as a sign that the Bank of Japan was less likely to raise interest rates to curb inflation, prompting them to push the benchmark stock index up 0.21 percent.The Bank of Japan said Monday that it had lent banks an additional ¥600 billion, or $5.07 billion, to help ensure adequate funding in the interbank market, after pumping ¥1 trillion into the market Friday. Central bankers in Australia and South Korea said they stood ready to inject funds if warranted. But outside of Japan and Australia, there have been no signs that central bankers are putting funds into the market or moving to defend their currencies. That could be because no other Asian countries are as deeply involved in the global credit boom as Japan and Australia.Japan is the source of much of what is known as the carry trade, in which investors borrow funds in Japan, where interest rates are very low, and invest them in countries where interest rates are relatively high or where currencies are rising, such as Australia.Analysts and economists have long surmised that hedge funds are particularly fond of this strategy. Thus, as their exposure to the deteriorating U.S. subprime mortgage market became evident, many investors have anticipated that hedge funds would reverse their carry trades, selling assets around Asia and repurchasing Japanese yen.Japanese domestic investors, however, are also taking advantage of this strategy, analysts say, so news that the Japanese economy is not taking off is also good news for smaller markets around the region. It means Japanese investors will not necessarily be pulling their funds back to Japan anytime soon.Analysts say investors in Asia should take comfort in what they said was a lower regional exposure to the kinds of credit risks battering some hedge funds and lenders in the United States and Europe.The amount of exposure to the U.S. subprime markets that Asian financial institutions have announced so far remain small, analysts said. ""There's nothing we've seen that makes us worry about the scale and implications of it,"" Mowat said.Analysts stressed that purchasing credit derivatives had become a standard hedging strategy among large financial institutions in Asia, just as it had in the West. Most financial firms have a percentage of assets that are nonperforming at any given time. So the kinds of losses and write-downs anticipated because of the decline in the U.S. housing market were not extraordinary, they said."
41,"TOKYO, Tuesday, Aug. 14 (Dow Jones) — The Bank of Japan drained 600 billion yen ($5 billion) from the money supply Tuesday morning, after pumping money into the system for two days to ease fears of a liquidity crisis.The bank injected 1 trillion yen on Friday and an additional 600 billion yen Monday. Central banks in Europe, the United States and Australia also pumped cash into the system in the face of credit fears set off by the subprime mortgage meltdown in the United States.The Japanese bank took the action after the overnight call rate stood Tuesday morning at 0.1 percent, far below the target of 0.5 percent, a sign of excess liquidity in the system, said a bank official, Hirotaki Hideshima.The goal is to bring the rate back to 0.5 percent, he said, but it is too soon to gauge the impact.“Rates were trading low this morning, so as a natural response we’re absorbing funds,” Mr. Hideshima said. “Yesterday and today the rates were strong after we provided funds, so this is just a symmetric response.”On Monday, he said it was possible that the rise Friday and Monday in the overnight rate — an indication that banks had grown more cautious about lending — was tied to the subprime problems abroad.On Tuesday, however, Mr. Hideshima said reports that the Bank of Japan’s injections were part of a concerted global effort to head off a credit crisis had been overblown. The injections and draining are part of the central bank’s normal operations each day, he said.One analyst at a foreign investment bank said Tuesday’s low rate showed that banks no longer expected the Japanese central bank to raise interest rates this month and that the pace of future rate increases will slow as the concerns about subprime lending ripple through global financial markets."
42,"SYDNEY —The global fallout from the collapse of the U.S. market for risky mortgages deepened Tuesday, with two Australian lenders warning investors and consumers of troubles in their businesses.Rams Home Loans Group said it was forced to pay more to cover its financing due to ""unprecedented disruptions"" in U.S. financial markets in recent weeks. The mortgage company said that if market volatility continued, the effect on Rams's earnings was ""likely to be material.""The chief executive of Bluestone Mortgages, a second Australian lender that is carrying a large number of loans to clients with histories of credit problems, warned of similar difficulties during an interview with an Australian newspaper. Alistair Jeffery, the lender's chief, told the newspaper, The Australian, that he expected to pass higher funding costs on to the consumer.Bluestone did not return calls seeking comment.Concerns about problems at Rams weighed on markets throughout Asia on Tuesday. A broad measure of stocks in Asia, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific index, declined 0.2 percent to 149.05 by early evening in Tokyo. (Page 13)Bourses in Europe also opened lower. Concerns about turmoil in financial markets heightened after UBS, the Swiss bank that is one of Europe's largest, said that ""turbulent"" markets could cut into profit later this year.""This is a global issue that has emigrated out of the U.S., and there has been a contagion effect and it has impacted corporates who are funded through the U.S. debt market,"" Nick Hughes, an analyst with UBS in Sydney, said when asked about widening problems in the Australian market.The news from Rams marks the first time that ripples in the financial markets have so clearly crossed over into fields that affect ordinary consumers in the Asia-Pacific region.Until now, the damage in Australia had been limited to two investment funds that were forced to bar withdrawals and a third that announced that it had to sell assets to prevent it from falling afoul of its loan obligations.Although neither Rams nor Bluestone Mortgages is suffering from increased rates of default in their domestic markets, both have fallen victim to the crisis of confidence in global debt markets set off by the collapse of the subprime loan market in the United States.An increase in the number of defaults by subprime borrowers - typically homeowners with low credit ratings - has triggered falls in asset prices in the broader credit markets.Lenders are now more wary of risk, leading to so-called higher spreads, in which loans with greater risk are charged at higher interest rates and less money is being lent.Rams, which has 14.6 billion Australian dollars, or $12 billion, worth of loans, said in a statement that it was still too early to say how much the turmoil in the credit markets would affect its bottom line. The group stressed that it had continued to be able to grant loans, but said that it was having to pay more to secure the money.""Given the current volatility in the global debt markets, the directors believe that it is premature to determine with certainty the extent of the likely negative financial impact on Rams for the 2008 financial year. However, if current market conditions continue, it is likely to be material,"" the group said in its statement.Shares of Rams, which just last month were listed on the stock exchange for the first time, dropped 34 cents, or 19 percent, to 1.41 dollars Tuesday.Australia, which has more sophisticated financial markets than many of its Asian neighbors, and so greater exposure to the U.S. turmoil, has been particularly badly hit.John Edwards, chief economist at HSBC in Sydney, said he believed Australia would eventually pull through the current crisis.""We haven't had significant default rates, and we didn't have a burst of subprime-type lending: 100 percent against valuation, no employment checks and things like that,"" he said. ""But there are follow-on effects that everyone is feeling that I think will be transitory."""
43,"FRANKFURT —The European Central Bank on Tuesday declared recent financial market turmoil largely over, a sign that the bank was likely to proceed with a plan to lift borrowing costs in early September to curb inflation caused by a rising economy.The liquidity crunch during the past week, which the ECB and other central banks smoothed over with massive cash infusions, had led many investors to reassess whether the ECB would tighten credit when it meets Sept. 6.But the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, in a rare and formal written statement, said Tuesday that ""market conditions have gone progressively back to normal,"" as private lenders were beginning to resume their normal routine of extending regular credit to worthy borrowers.Trichet added that investors had heeded his call two weeks ago to ""maintain their composure.""""This attitude has been welcome and effective in the recent days,"" Trichet said. ""It will help consolidate a smooth return to a normal assessment of risks in liquid markets.""At the same time, the German central bank said that the effect on the largest economy in the euro-zone from the mortgage losses in the United States that triggered the current crisis will be ""limited overall.""Trichet's statement highlighted how, within the ECB, decision-makers saw no contradiction in supplying liquidity and then raising rates soon thereafter.The first measure is short-term and largely technical, designed to strengthen trust among banks that, panicky about the spillover, had squeezed their overnight lending to one another. But higher interest rates, while they do tighten credit, work in the medium term to control inflation, the bank's main priority.Still, the bank is leaving itself an escape hatch. Earlier this month when Trichet first hinted at a September rate increase, he emphasized more than usual that the central bank would not ""pre-commit"" itself to a rate hike - least of all during uncertain times.""It still depends on whether we return to stability in the markets,"" said Kenneth Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas in London, said of the possibility of a September rate increase. ""If we go back to a period of turmoil, it's hard to believe they would raise.""The ECB has lifted borrowing costs eight times since the end of 2005, to 4 percent, as the European expansion gained momentum. Higher interest rates have also helped lift the value of the euro, causing concern among politicians, mainly in France, that the ECB might be quashing the recovery.""The paradox is that with its strategy of rate rises the ECB is at the same time making credit more expensive,"" a former finance minister of France, Thierry Breton, said Monday, Reuters reported.Yet if the ECB abandons plans for lifting rates in September, it could fan further concern that the central bank is privy to bad news not yet made public.""If the bank now delays its rate increase,"" said Kenneth Broux, an economist at Lloyds TSB in London, ""it will create suspicions it knows something that the markets do not.""New data released Tuesday showed that the pace of economic growth in the 13-nation euro-zone slowed in the second quarter to 0.3 percent - about half the rate of the first quarter. France and Germany, the two largest euro members, also registered 0.3 percent growth during the same period, less than economists had forecast, but in line with the ECB prognosis of steady growth that would allow it to raise its benchmark rate by a quarter percentage point.Despite the slowing, Axel Weber, the president of the German Bundesbank, said Tuesday that losses related to the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage sector would be ""limited overall.""IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a small German bank, sent shudders through markets recently when a default gave rise to a government-engineered rescue. But Weber said other German financial institutions are sound.""We have confirmed our impression that the increased risks in certain market segments are insulated and that the profit impact for credit institutions is limited overall,"" Weber said. The recent problems at IKB are a one-time case, he said, specific to that institution.Taken together, the statements by the Bundesbank and the ECB appeared to be a broad offensive aimed at closing the door on short-term panic and easing the way for stability.The ECB, injected €7.7 billion in one-day liquidity into the system Tuesday, a far smaller amount than the €94.8 billion it infused Friday into seized-up markets. The reduced amount of cash is a sign that the market for overnight loans among private banks is largely functioning without the ECB.Weber's statement was aimed at assure markets that no more surprises along the lines of IKB are in the offing, since markets feared German lenders might be hiding greater losses. In the next few days, many European companies will need to roll over short-term debt, but that will only happen if investors are confident the worst is over.""The most important step is to ease the 'information crunch' that has almost paralyzed markets in the last few days,"" said Marco Annunziata, chief economist for UniCredit in London. ""The German banking system was in the spotlight.""Other events Tuesday also suggested the worst of the current crisis may have passed.Two Australian lenders, Bluestone Mortgages and Rams Home Loans Group, said that their earnings would take a hit as a result of financial market gyrations, while Swiss giant UBS said that its profit would probably decline for the same reason. But the news did not trigger a broad sell-off, as it might have only a week ago."
44,"If there is a crisis in global financial markets, it was not apparent in Asia and Europe Monday. And on Wall Street, the week got off to an unremarkable start.Stock prices were up moderately but broadly in the United States for most of the day, with little of the volatility that had characterized the markets last week. But the major indexes shed their modest gains late in the trading session and finished the day not far from where they closed on Friday.When trading ended, the Dow Jones industrial average closed down 3.01 points, at 13,263.53. The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index and the Nasdaq composite were each off 0.1 percent or less.A number of early developments appeared to help put investors at ease Monday. Before the market opened, the government reported that retail sales rose in July at a solid pace. With mortgage markets tightening and home values dropping in many parts of the country, some economists have questioned whether consumer spending could stand up.Also, Goldman Sachs moved Monday to shore up one of its hedge funds that has suffered huge losses in the recent market turmoil. The investment bank said it and other investors would add $3 billion to the fund.Separately, the Federal Reserve Monday added more money into the financial system, providing $2 billion in loans in an effort to help calm the markets.Financial stocks were a drag on the market Monday. Countrywide Financial, the nation's largest mortgage lender, closed at $26.61, down 4 percent, and Fannie Mae was off 3.5 percent at $64.12.Technology equipment and telecommunications stocks were among the strongest performers. EMC, the data storage company, was up 7.5 percent to $19.05 ahead of the initial public offering of its VMware unit this week. Hewlett-Packard gained 2.6 percent to $48.43, and Sprint Nextel was up 3.4 percent at $19.49.In Europe Monday, stock indexes in Paris and Frankfurt finished about 2 percent higher, and British stocks were up almost 3 percent.The day's tone was set in Asia, where some of the region's biggest markets sprang back Monday after a slide last Friday. They were helped by the slight recovery in American markets after the close of Asian markets late last Friday.Australia's benchmark index gained 1.3 percent and South Korea's main index rose 1.6 percent.Reflecting some of the inverse logic that seems to govern markets of late, Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average index closed slightly higher on news that the country's economic growth was slowing, and that the central bank had lent an additional $5 billion to banks to ensure adequate funds in the money market.Central banks from Australia to the United States made similar loans Monday. The European Central Bank added $65.3 billion to the markets Monday.Last week, concerns about growing losses in the ailing market for subprime mortgages in the United States prompted many investors in Asia to take funds out of any investments that were considered relatively risky, either because they involved emerging markets or because they were tied to high levels of debt.The recovery Monday encouraged some analysts to sound a note of optimism. They pointed to a growing awareness that Asia is still flush with funds and doesn't suffer from the same reliance on debt as investors do in Europe and the United States.""The worst of it's behind us in Asian markets,"" said Adrian Mowat, a strategist at J.P. Morgan in Hong Kong. ""Asian monetary systems have been relatively flush with cash and growth here is typically being funded by earnings — household and corporate, rather than debt funding.""Others, however, warned that more surprises could be in store for the region and that Monday's recovery might in retrospect be only a temporary respite.""We think the volatility will continue for a while,"" said Hans Goetti, head of research strategy at Citi Private Bank in Singapore.There was, therefore, still an air of uncertainty in Asia Monday, analysts said, with investors selling stocks in some smaller markets and buying stocks in larger economies, especially financial and commodity-related stocks that had been pushed down last week.""As information flows out, people are waiting to see what happens next,"" said Rahul Malhotra, managing director for private banking in the Middle East and Pacific Rim at Merrill Lynch in Singapore.Merrill's advice to its clients, Malhotra said, was not to join the panic selling, advice he said that most appeared to be taking."
45,"LONDON —UBS, Europe's largest bank, on Tuesday painted the grimmest picture yet of the downside to recent market jitters on earnings, raising concerns about the sustainability of profit growth across the investment banking sector.The bank, based in Zurich, said in reporting its second-quarter earnings that if the current market turbulence continued throughout this quarter, it expected weak results from its investment banking arm, which represented a third of its pretax earnings. It said it expected ""predictable earnings"" from its other main businesses, wealth and asset management. ""This makes it likely that profits in the second half of 2007 will be lower than in the second half of last year"" UBS said.European banks, including BNP Paribas of France and IKB Deutsche Industriebank of Germany, this month were hit by the effects of the U.S. subprime lending crisis. Earnings at investment banks, which have enjoyed record returns from a boom market, might decline as recent market jitters prompt fewer share sales, refinancing of loans and lending for leveraged buyouts, which could hurt the market for mergers and acquisitions.""It is inevitable that it will be more difficult for investment banks because you could have hardly had better conditions in the markets at the beginning of the year,"" said Richard Scott, a fund manager at Iimia Investment Group in Britain.UBS shares fell 2.55 Swiss francs, or 3.9 percent, to close at 63.50 Swiss francs, or $52.48, in Zurich on Tuesday, the lowest level in a year, leading shares of other banks lower.UBS' dim outlook is as much the result of last week's market slump affecting most investment banks as its disproportionately high exposure to the U.S. subprime market, some analysts said.""It's a challenging market for all investment banks but there are some that stand out and on this side of the Atlantic it's UBS,"" said Kinner Lakhani, an analyst at ABN AMRO in London.UBS may have been unlucky with the timing of its earnings statement because it came after a turbulent two weeks in the financial markets. Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse Group, which both reported better-than-expected earnings at the beginning of this month, also mentioned more difficult market conditions but remained optimistic about long-term growth prospects. UBS did not discuss the longer term, focusing on the year's second half.Some analysts, including Matthew Clark at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London, said there was more to it than just timing. UBS is more exposed to the struggling U.S. subprime market than many of its European counterparts. Recent investments in its fixed-income operation have further weighed on earnings, as the bank hired staff in a boom market, driving up costs.U.S. subprime mortgage losses this year prompted the collapse of Dillon Read Capital Management, a UBS hedge fund operation, and led the bank to book losses connected to the fund for a second quarter in a row. But even after Dillon Read, UBS might be hurt by the fallout from the U.S. mortgage woes.The UBS market outlook overshadowed otherwise positive earnings that beat some analysts' estimates. Profit in the quarter through June rose 79 percent to a record 5.62 billion francs, helped by private banking and a gain from the sale of a stake in Julius Baer Holding."
46,"Turmoil in the subprime mortgage market spread again yesterday — this time to a type of short-term security held by money market mutual funds. These funds have become the investment of choice for many people seeking a safe haven.Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, warned yesterday that it might downgrade several issuers of commercial paper, a short-term I.O.U. by companies that promise to repay loans typically within a few weeks to a year.In these cases, S.& P. said, the commercial paper was backed by residential mortgages.The amount of commercial paper in the United States has grown to $2.2 trillion, according to Lehman Brothers, with about $1.2 trillion backed by residential mortgages, credit card receivables, car loans and other bonds. The major buyers include pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and short-term money market funds.Investors have flocked to money market funds as they try to avoid volatile stocks and the seized-up bond market. Last week, more than $36 billion moved into money market funds, the largest shift since December 2005. In all, some $2.6 trillion is in money market funds, according to AMG Data Services.Such funds are sold to investors as the equivalent of cash, and their $1-a-share net asset value is considered inviolate. But if the funds experienced big losses, the value of the assets could be vulnerable.The S.& P acted a day after a $1.6 billion cash-management fund run by the Sentinel Management Group halted redemptions because it could not sell its assets at what it considered acceptable prices.Until recently, the crisis in the credit markets has been limited to problems related to subprime mortgages, those given to borrowers with questionable credit histories. But as these troubles seep into other parts of the securities markets, fears of losses are rising in unexpected places.The borrowers, companies that issue asset-backed commercial paper, have found it highly profitable. These companies usually have used the money they borrow to buy securities like slices of mortgage pools that generated yields much greater than the interest paid to the short-term lenders.But there are several risks. First, the companies that issue short-term notes backed by assets with considerably longer terms are exposing themselves to the risk that the interest they earn will not exceed the amount they must pay to their lenders. Perhaps more significant, the borrowers must be concerned about possible losses in the assets they buy, especially when investors will no longer lend them money by buying their commercial paper.The S.& P. highlighted three issuers of commercial paper for possible downgrading. Broadhollow Funding, which was set up by American Home Mortgage Investment, a lender that filed for bankruptcy last week; KKR Atlantic Funding Trust and KKR Pacific Funding Trust, two affiliates of the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; and Ottimo Funding, an affiliate of Aladdin Capital Management, an investment manager in Stamford, Conn.Kohlberg Kravis declined to comment yesterday.Ottimo Funding holds about $3 billion in residential mortgages, all rated AAA. George Marshman, chief investment officer at Aladdin, said: “It’s a negotiation process. We’re working with all the investors to make things as orderly as possible. I’m optimistic we can get a good outcome.”Among the money market funds that held commercial paper issued by the companies singled out for possible downgrading were two offered by Evergreen Investments. As of May, the $16.6 billion Evergreen Institutional Money Market Fund held $385 million in Broadhollow Funding and $72 million in Ottimo Funding. The $4.5 billion Evergreen Prime Cash Management Money Market Fund held $50 million in Ottimo Funding as well.A spokeswoman for Evergreen declined to comment.Legg Mason’sMaster Portfolio Trust Liquid Reserves Portfolio, a $52.5 billion fund, owned almost $200 million in securities issued by Ottimo Funding and $750 million in KKR Atlantic Funding.Mary K. Athridge, a Legg Mason spokeswoman, said in a statement: “The holdings represent less than 1.4 percent of the portfolio. We believe the current disruption in the marketplace is liquidity-related rather than credit-related, which the Fed has stepped into the market to address.”As of May 31, Columbia Funds Series Trust Cash Reserves, a $62 billion fund, had a $120 million stake in Ottimo Funding and $400 million in KKR Pacific Funding Trust. A Columbia Management spokesman did not return calls for comment.“If the stigma of mortgage-related extendable-asset-backed commercial paper spreads to asset-backed commercial paper as a whole, you could see bailout events,” said Peter G. Crane, president of Crane Data, the publisher of a newsletter about money market mutual funds. But he added: “The stuff that the money funds are invested in are the highest quality, so it’s the last thing to have trouble.”However, the investment strategies that once were considered conservative no longer are.The Sentinel fund that banned redemptions Monday advertised itself as risk-averse. In a letter to investors, Sentinel said that it had hoped to ride out the troubles but was unable to do so.“We are concerned that we cannot meet any significant redemption requests without selling securities at deep discounts to their fair value and therefore causing unnecessary losses to our clients,” the letter said. “We will continue to monitor the markets and we will raise cash as opportunities present themselves.”Sentinel officials did not return calls for comment.Douglas A. Kass, general partner of Seabreeze Partners Management, an investment firm in Palm Beach, Fla., said the Sentinel disclosure and upheaval in commercial paper markets are examples of the risks investors take when they reach for higher yields.“This is symptomatic of a whole body of investors, including money market and cash management funds, that are attempting to enhance yields, and this is the downside to that journey,” he said.On Monday, Coventree, a Canadian financial services company, said it could no longer issue asset-backed commercial paper because of a liquidity squeeze. In a statement, the firm said that “problems that initially seemed isolated to a few U.S. subprime mortgage lenders have led to broader concerns relating to debt capital markets generally,” including the market for Canadian asset-backed commercial paper.Coventree extended maturities on 250 million Canadian dollars ($237 million) and sought emergency funding for an additional 700 million Canadian dollars ($664 million).In its third-quarter financial statement yesterday, Coventree said: “Certain liquidity providers have advanced funding, some have disagreed that they have an obligation to fund, some are in discussions with the company, and some have not responded. There is no assurance that the liquidity providers will fund or be obligated to fund under the requisite liquidity agreements.”Canadian companies have issued 170 billion Canadian dollars ($161 billion) in commercial paper, according to a Lehman Brothers research report citing Bank of Canada data. About 116 billion Canadian dollars ($110 billion) of that market is asset-backed commercial paper, up from 66 billion Canadian dollars ($63 billion) at the beginning of 2005."
47,"BEIJING —China's industrial output slowed more than expected in July after tax changes made exports less attractive, suggesting to some economists that the country's politically sensitive trade surplus could shrink in coming months.The output growth of 18 percent, which came a day after a strong rise in retail sales, could point to softness in fixed-asset investment when monthly figures are released Thursday, some economists said.""With external demand and private consumption proving resilient, the modest easing in industrial production momentum could be due to some moderation in domestic investment growth in July,"" said Qian Wang, an economist with JPMorgan Chase in Hong Kong.Economists said the slower pace of output did not change the broader policy picture.Many expect the central bank, which has raised interest rates three times so far in 2007, to do so again this quarter to rein in inflation, which has jumped to a 10-year high of 5.6 percent because of runaway food prices.However, policy makers will also be aware of the shadows cast over the world economy by the fallout from the crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market. Another worry is the booming China stock market, which keeps defying gravity.Economists said that unsettled global market conditions could explain why the central bank in recent weeks has halted the yuan's steady climb, making the currency more or less mark time.Factories churned out 18 percent more goods than in July 2006, down from 19.4 percent growth in June, the National Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday.Economists had expected a rise of 19.2 percent.""The surprising slowdown in industrial output was partly caused by the reduction in export tax rebates,"" said Zhao Qingming, an economist with China Construction Bank in Beijing.China scrapped or cut tax rebates, effective July 1, on nearly 3,000 export lines, including metals and textiles, to help reduce its record trade surplus and discourage companies from making low-value, energy-intensive goods.In fact, export growth accelerated in July, but economists said this was due to companies shipping goods that had been ordered before the tax changes were announced.But with China's official survey of manufacturers showing declines in overseas orders and industrial output for three months in a row, many economists believe that exports will lose steam over the rest of 2007.""As manufacturers expect export growth to decline, they are now cutting their production a month ahead of time,"" said Gene Ma, chief economist with China Economic Business Monitor, an independent research house in Beijing.Yet another safety scandal concerning Chinese goods - this time the recall of millions of toys by Mattel because of lead paint and small magnets that could be swallowed and cause injury - may also hurt demand for made-in-China goods.Ma said China would be hit by widening credit market strains if they sap U.S. economic growth and thus reduce demand for Chinese goods. Mingchun Sun at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong agreed.""Given the turmoil in global financial markets and uncertainty in the global economic outlook, Chinese exports may be facing tougher times in the future,"" he said."
48,"FRANKFURT —A day after the European Central Bank made a concerted effort to calm financial markets, stocks retreated worldwide Wednesday, as investors pondered whether the worst news about the deteriorating U.S. mortgage industry had passed.Major market indexes in the United States declined more than 1 percent, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing below 13,000 for the first time since April 24.Financial stocks led a broad retreat, highlighting the hypersensitivity of markets reacting to news that in calmer times might be ignored.The corporate woes of the day began when two of Japan's biggest banks, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial, reported losses on investments connected to U.S. subprime lending, which serves borrowers with spotty credit records.The troubles were compounded in Australia, where Basis Capital Fund Management told investors that losses at one of its hedge funds might exceed 80 percent, as creditors obliged the company, based in Sydney, to sell assets, according to Bloomberg News.Later in the day, the U.S. market, which had been rising, was shaken by a Merrill Lynch report which said that Countrywide Financial, a leading U.S. mortgage lender, could face bankruptcy if liquidity worsened. Merill downgraded the stock to ""sell"" from ""buy,"" sending its shares down 13 percent.Investors worldwide appeared fearful that the subprime crisis in the United States might worsen there, or lead to new manifestations abroad. The instability there was exported through securities backed by now-questionable mortgages, and the prospect that another big fund - or even a bank - might report new losses weighed heavily on the market.""This is a great intransparency we now have to live with,"" said Ralf Grönemeyer, an equity strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. ""Until we know more about where the losses are or could be, what can we do?""Goldman Sachs sized up the depth of the potential problem with a calculation that there was roughly $110 billion in European exposure to securities from the U.S. mortgage market. Only 20 percent of that is from the subprime sector, and spread out over many investment funds and a few banks, but markets in such securities have creaked to a halt, making it impossible to value them or to use them as collateral for short-term lending.The result is one more uncertainty in a world that, over all, appears set to notch up solid growth this year.""From a trading perspective, it is very difficult to keep to the big picture in mind,"" said Jens Nordvig, a senior global markets economist with Goldman Sachs in New York. ""In these situations there is tremendous uncertainty about variables that people do not have to worry about normally.""The Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan fell by almost 2.2 percent Wednesday to its lowest point in nine months. Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan all fell by around 3 percent.On a day marked by holidays in Italy, Luxembourg, Greece and Austria, benchmark national indexes slid across most of Europe. The CAC 40 in France fell 0.7 percent, while the FTSE 100 in Britain lost 0.6 percent. In Germany, the Dax rose 0.3 percent.The Dow industrials, which rose above 14,000 in July, fell 167.45 points, or 1.3 percent, to close at 12,861.47. The S&P 500-stock index fell 1.4 percent, wiping out its gains for the year, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 1.6 percent.Despite the declaration Tuesday from the European Central Bank that the immediate crisis was all but over, a tense atmosphere of uncertainty - mixed, perhaps, with slight foreboding - pervaded financial markets. Panic was not evident, but neither was a renewed appetite for risk, an essential element in closing the door on any financial crisis.European traders sold financial industry stocks, after some analysts downgraded their recommendations on UBS, the Swiss bank that said Tuesday the market turmoil would hurt earnings, and Deutsche Bank, a company that derives a large share of its profits from trading in what is now an extremely volatile market.Events Wednesday bore out the ECB's assessment the previous day that tensions had passed in the overnight lending market, which has been buoyed by the liquidity infusions since last Thursday. The ECB injected no fresh cash into the market Wednesday, while some Asian central banks even began mopping up some excess liquidity, and the U.S. Federal Reserve put $7 billion into the market, a tiny sum by its standards.With the overnight lending easing into its normal rhythm, attention was turning to whether the market for ""commercial paper,"" the short-term debt used to finance day-to-day operations, would follow suit. Toward the end of the month, much short-term debt typically falls due, raising the specter of a mass shortage of credit.Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, warned Tuesday that it might downgrade several issuers of commercial paper. That same day, a Canadian fund manager, Coventree, sent a scare through markets when it said it could not sell a planned issue. The company ultimately said it found buyers for $557 million in debt.The trillion-dollar hedge fund industry remained another source of doubt in investor minds. These lightly regulated pools of money work under few disclosure requirements, and give their investors limited windows in which to withdraw their money.Robert Howie, head of European hedge fund research at Mercer Investment Consulting in London, said, ""We should be able to get better visibility towards the end of this month or the beginning of next.""Also amid the turmoil, the euro has given back some of its gains after reaching record levels above $1.38 in July.The euro fell below $1.35 Wednesday, only a few weeks after traders actively discussed the possibility it would go to $1.40. Recent data showed that European growth slowed in the second quarter.""One of the big factors over the last year has been money flowing into European stocks,"" said Chris Turner, head of foreign exchange research at ING Baring. ""So if the cyclical story doesn't look quite as positive, that has an impact on the euro.""Julia Werdigier in London and Wayne Arnold in Singapore contributed reporting."
