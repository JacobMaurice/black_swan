0,"Bear Stearns Companies, the investment bank, pledged up to $3.2 billion in loans yesterday to bail out one of its hedge funds that was collapsing because of bad bets on subprime mortgages.It is the biggest rescue of a hedge fund since 1998 when more than a dozen lenders provided $3.6 billion to save Long-Term Capital Management.The crisis this week from the near collapse of two hedge funds managed by Bear Stearns stems directly from the slumping housing market and the fallout from loose lending practices that showered money on people with weak, or subprime, credit, leaving many of them struggling to stay in their homes.Bear Stearns averted a meltdown this time, but if delinquencies and defaults on subprime loans surge, Wall Street firms, hedge funds and pension funds could be left holding billions of dollars in bonds and securities backed by loans that are quickly losing their value.Bear Stearns acted yesterday after the hedge fund and a related fund had suffered millions in losses and after shocked investors had begun asking for their money back. The firm agreed to buy out several Wall Street banks that had lent the fund money, which managers hoped would avoid a broader sell-off without causing a meltdown in the once-booming market for mortgage securities.The firm is, meanwhile, negotiating with banks to rescue the second, larger fund started last August, which has more than $6 billion in loans and reportedly holds far riskier investments. Those negotiations were continuing yesterday, and it was unclear whether they would be successful.“We don’t think it is over,” said Girish V. Reddy, managing director of Prisma Capital Partners, which invests in other hedge funds. “More funds will feel the pain, but not many are as leveraged as the Bear fund.”Nervousness about the souring subprime loans and rising oil prices sent the stock market plummeting. Already down almost 60 points, the Dow Jones industrial average fell sharply after the announcement of the bailout andclosed down 185.58 points.Shares of Bear Stearns closed down $2.06, to $143.75; the stock was down more than 4 percent for the week.For Bear Stearns, the drama surrounding its two troubled hedge funds has given it and its prestigious mortgage business a black eye. The bailout was a major departure for the firm, which has long resisted putting too much of its own capital at risk.But in this case, the stakes were too high. If lenders had seized the assets of the funds and tried to sell billions of dollars in mortgage-related securities at fire-sale prices, it could have exposed Bear Stearns and the market to substantial losses.While the board of Bear Stearns never met over the funds, all of its top executives, including the chief executive, James E. Cayne; its presidents, Alan D. Schwartz and Warren J. Spector; and the chief financial officer, Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., huddled in meetings over the last few days looking to find a way to contain the crisis, according to people briefed on the discussions who could not speak for attribution.Even Alan C. Greenberg, the 79-year-old former chairman, who spends less time these days on the firm’s matters but remains an active board member, became involved.Yet, as Bear Stearns worked to manage the crisis, many on Wall Street speculated about how the firm could let the funds get in such a precarious position.In fact, executives at Bear Stearns Asset Management had debated last summer whether to start the second hedge fund.The first fund, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Fund — the one bailed out yesterday — was started in 2004 and had done well, posting 41 months of positive returns of about 1 percent to 1.5 percent a month. But investors were clamoring for even higher yields, which would require more aggressive bets on riskier mortgage-related securities and significantly higher levels of borrowed money, or leverage, to bolster returns.The firm clearly had the expertise — it was a leader in underwriting and trading bonds and esoteric securities backed by mortgages. In addition, Ralph R. Cioffi, who ran the funds, had played a major role in building the Bear Stearns mortgage business.So, in August, the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund — the second fund that eventually had huge losses — was started with $600 million in investments, mostly from wealthy individual clients of Bear Stearns, and at least $6 billion in money borrowed from banks and brokerage firms. Bear Stearns and a handful of its top executives invested a mere $40 million in both funds.The timing could not have been worse.By the end of last year, housing prices in many areas were cresting and beginning to fall. The decline began to expose lax lending standards in the subprime market. Soon borrowers started falling behind on payments just months after they closed on their loans, forcing several large lenders into bankruptcy protection.The Bear Stearns funds, like so many others, had invested in collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, which invest in bonds backed by hundreds of loans and other financial instruments. Wall Street sells CDOs in slices to investors. Some of those pieces have low yields but they are easily traded and carry less risk; others are more susceptible to defaults and trade infrequently, which makes them difficult to value.Last year, $316.4 billion in mortgage-related CDOs were issued, about 77 percent more than the year before, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association said.At first, the Bear Stearns hedge funds appeared to weather the storm. But in March, the older fund registered its first loss. One investor, who asked not to be identified because he was trying to recover his investment, said that when he moved to get his money out, he was told investors had tried to redeem 10 percent of the fund.By April, the older fund was down by 5 percent for the year, and the newer fund had fallen 10 percent.Managers tried to protect the fund by hedging potential losses in lower-rated securities they held, but did not do so for higher-rated bonds, which also fell in value.“They didn’t realize this was Katrina,” the investor said. “They thought it was just another storm.”In May, however, more significant problems began to emerge. The Swiss investment bank UBS shut its hedge fund arm, Dillon Read Capital Management, after bad subprime bets led to a $124 million loss.Also that month, Bear Stearns Asset Management filed plans to start a public offering of a financial services firm called Everquest Financial, which, to some, appeared to be little more than a place to park the riskiest securities Bear Stearns had invested in. (The firm has no plans for now to move forward with the offering, according to a person briefed on the firm’s plans.)Perhaps the most startling development was a sharp restatement in April of the second fund. The firm revalued some securities and told investors that the fund was down 23 percent, not 10 percent as it had said earlier.Shocked investors began contacting Bear Stearns, demanding to pull their money out. In May, the firm froze all redemption requests. This month, at least three Wall Street firms — JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Merrill Lynch — began demanding more cash as collateral for the loans they had made.Fighting to save the funds, Bear Stearns sold $3.6 billion in high-grade securities. Meanwhile, its adviser, Blackstone, scrambled to line up a deal in which Bear Stearns would put up $1.5 billion in new loans and a consortium of banks led by Citigroup and Barclays would put in $500 million.In return, the lenders would have their exposure to the funds reduced but could not make further margin calls for 12 months.Some lenders, including Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank, balked and moved to sell assets. At one point Wednesday, nearly $2 billion in securities were listed for sale, although some banks, including JPMorgan, eventually canceled scheduled auctions.By the end of the day, out of the $850 million in securities that Merrill had put up for sale, only a small portion actually sold.In the wake of the weak auctions, several other lenders, including JPMorgan, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America, reached deals with Bear Stearns. At least some of the deals involved the lenders selling the securities back to Bear Stearns for cash, although the prices were not disclosed.Bear Stearns is bailing one of the funds out because it is worried about the damage to its reputation if it stuck investors and lenders with big losses, said Dick Bove, an analyst with Punk Ziegel & Company.“If they walked away from it, investors would have lost all their money and lenders would have lost all of the money,” Mr. Bove said. But “if they did that to everyone in the financial community, the financial community would have shut them down.”"

2,"NEW YORK —Over the weekend of June 17, executives at Bear Stearns scrambled to avert the collapse of two hedge funds.Officers at other Wall Street banks that had provided billions of dollars in loans to the funds began to question why Bear Stearns was not stepping in to bail them out.In the midst of the turmoil, Richard Marin, the head of the Bear unit that ran the troubled funds, ""stole away"" from the ""crisis-hedge-fund-salvation-workaholic weekend"" to see the new Kevin Costner thriller ""Mr. Brooks.""His advice on the film?Take a ""pass,"" Marin wrote in a review he posted that day on his blog, whimofiron.blogspot.com.""I had been working 24-7 on this thing. Taking a small amount of time to clear my head seemed reasonable,"" Marin said Wednesday. The blog was personal, he said, intended for his friends and family. It let him talk about movies, life on Wall Street and his efforts to lose weight.Still, the episode - and Marin's blog - offer some insight into Bear's response to the near collapse of the funds. An embarrassing hit to the bank's reputation, the incident has forced Bear to pledge up to $1.6 billion in secured loans to bail out one of the hedge funds. It is not providing any financing for the second, much more heavily leveraged fund, which was started in August and has suffered much bigger losses.But Bear Stearns' troubles are far from over. The Securities and Exchange Commission has started an informal inquiry into issues surrounding the Bear hedge funds and how the industry is valuing mortgage-related securities like those that Bear holds.In addition, Bear Stearns has temporarily shifted its top mortgage trader, Thomas Marano, over to the unit, Bear Stearns Asset Management, to help with the funds, say people who were briefed but were unauthorized to speak for attribution. They added, however, that assets in the two funds have already been reduced by 90 percent through sales and agreements with creditors.Standing in the middle of this firestorm is Marin, a Wall Street veteran who spent 25 years at Bankers Trust, where he helped develop its derivative business.When Marin joined Bear Stearns Asset Management four years ago, the unit was considered a sleepy backwater inside the bank, largely overlooked for faster growing, more profitable businesses.""When I joined Bear, Bear had not run the business as aggressively as they wanted to. The way they put it to me was, 'Bear wants to succeed in whatever it does and that includes asset management,' "" Marin said Wednesday.He set a course to bolster the unit's profit and its stature by shedding unprofitable businesses - like its retail mutual fund distribution arm - and focusing on starting products with richer fees, like hedge funds and structured credit securities for its institutional and wealthy clients.It is the same strategy undertaken by many Wall Street firms. But in the wake of the crisis involving the two hedge funds, which nearly triggered a broader sell-off in the market for mortgage-related securities, it helps illustrate the potential risks Wall Street firms are increasingly willing to take to improve profit in their asset management arms.""If you want to stay alive in the asset management business, you have to go into unique products and go out on the risk spectrum. You have to do the things that Bear Stearns did,"" said Richard Bove, an analyst with Punk, Ziegel & Co. ""Until as of late, the strategy was working out beautifully for them.""Since Marin took over the Bear unit, assets under management have nearly doubled to $60 billion and revenue has risen 138 percent, to $332 million at the end of last year.Soon after joining the Bear unit in 2003, Marin devised a strategy that was known internally as ""10 in 10."" He wanted the division's profit to represent roughly 10 percent of Bear Stearns' revenue and profit by 2010.He was starting at a low base; the unit's share of revenue in 2003 was about 1 percent. Its share of the company's overall profit was even less.To reach that goal, Marin needed to develop products that had richer fees and higher profit margins, and he turned much of his effort toward hedge funds, said two former employees who did not want to speak for attribution because they are still involved in the industry.Marin tapped the brokerage side of the business for talent, bringing over traders from Bear Stearns' proprietary desks and giving them seed money to start hedge funds.One of those tapped in 2003 was Ralph Cioffi, a longtime bond salesman who had been trading Bear Stearns' own money for about six months. Cioffi was brought over to start a hedge fund, the High-Grade Structured Credit Fund, that would invest in bonds and securities backed by subprime mortgages.While some of the mortgage-related securities were easily valued and traded, others, like collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs, do not frequently trade and can be very difficult to value.""His concept had been looked at carefully for six months using the firm's own money, and it was decided he would be appropriate to bring over to BSAM and start taking and running client money,"" Marin said.""He had come up with an approach to trading those assets that people who are experts in that arena thought was a sound and interesting approach.""The approach was so successful that the company started a sister fund last summer, the High-Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leverage Fund, that would use even more leverage.The timing of that fund, however, could not have been worse; the cooling housing market began to reveal the lax lending standards used by subprime lenders. Last fall, delinquencies and defaults began rising, making the environment for trading and valuing the esoteric securities that are related to those loans much more difficult.Marin declined to answer questions about the second fund, which Bear Stearns is still negotiating with creditors on.However, his blog, where access was restricted after he was questioned about it, reveals that the last few weeks have indeed been challenging. On Saturday, he posted an entry saying he had spent two weeks ""trying to defend Sparta against the Persians hordes of Wall Street.""""Nothing like a good dog fight 24x7 for a few weeks to remind you why you chose the life you chose,"" he wrote. ""The good news is that after two embattled weeks both I and my loyal staff are still standing to fight another day."""

4,"James Cayne has a bellyache.And it is not from the crash diet that has caused Cayne, the chief executive of Bear Stearns, to shed 20 pounds over the last year.Bear Stearns, the firm Cayne has worked at since 1969 and guided since 1993, has seen its carefully honed reputation for sound risk management and cautious investing suffer, what he felt to be, a ""body blow of massive proportion,"" from the near-collapse of two hedge funds run by its asset management division.""I'm angry,"" he said as he took a deep puff on a freshly lit Montecristo cigar in a conference room next to his office. ""When you walk around with the reputation for being the most rigorous risk analyzer, assessor, controller and that is trashed, well you have got to feel bad. This is personal.""In the last two weeks, Bear has found itself in a fiasco that some within the firm say is unrivaled in its 84-year history. While the unraveling of the funds is not expected to effect the bank's bottom line, it has made the firm a potential target for regulators and class-action lawyers.[Bloomberg News reported Friday that Bear hired Jeffrey Lane from Lehman Brothers Holdings to run its asset-management division after the near-collapse of two hedge funds forced the firm to put up $1.6 billion for a bailout.Lane, 65, replaces Richard Marin, who would remain at Bear as an adviser, the firm said in statement. Lane was chief executive officer of Neuberger Berman until 2003, when Lehman bought the money manager. He has been a vice chairman at Lehman since then.]Front and center in the crisis is Cayne, 73, the oldest chief executive of a Wall Street firm, who is confronted with salvaging the firm's reputation.Cayne is a world-class bridge player who did not finish college and whose first job was as a traveling salesman selling copiers in the Midwest. His ascent has been the result of a card player's guile, a brilliant run trading the distressed bonds of New York City in the early 1970s and a boundless belief in his abilities and that of his firm.""It's an amazing story,"" said Michael Ledeen, the foreign policy analyst and Cayne's bridge partner. ""He didn't go to Harvard Business School - he was a bridge bum,"" Ledeen said, and Ace Greenberg, Cayne's predecessor, needed a partner.""Ace said come work at Bear,"" Ledeen said, ""and then Jimmy made a market in New York City municipal bonds and then the frog turned into the prince.""The problems with the two funds, have shaken Cayne.""In the last 15 years, I have never walked into a room or been at a dinner party where I did not feel that when people looked at me they thought I was OK, successful, agile,"" he said. ""That might have changed. I feel like people now look at me with a question mark.""Despite his contrition, legal experts say Cayne is likely to face tough questions from regulators and lawyers for investors over how, in a firm known for its risk controls, a trader could make such a disastrous bet.""This is a guy that is in the loop - he is an activist CEO,"" said Jacob Zamansky, a securities lawyer who represents individual investors. ""He can't say that he knew nothing if there is a responsibility to be on top of the different business units. The proof will be in the e-mails and the documents.""Bear Stearns and Cayne have survived other crises. The firm has paid fines for its ties to fraudulent brokerage houses and investment firms that engaged in illegal mutual fund tradzing. But its scrappy disposition and a tightly knit culture that is bolstered by the 31 percent employee ownership stake has helped sustain the firm.Until this year, its stock has outperformed its peers, in part because of a dominant position in the booming mortgage securities and hedge fund services markets, and a growing recognition of its influence as a niche investment banker to companies like Cablevision, Walt Disney and Verizon.Ledeen has written a book about the leadership lessons of Machiavelli, and Cayne has devoured it.""Jimmy saw himself in Machiavelli,"" Ledeen said. ""He too is living in a world that is very corrupt and where temptation is huge.But you have to get rid of failure and you have to punish lack of virtue ruthlessly and all the time. Jimmy does not trust second chances - if he finds someone who misbehaves he gets rid of him.Fast.""It is perhaps this sensibility that forms Cayne's extreme caution when it comes to putting the firm's capital at risk. Over the years as firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have become more aggressive in trading their own capital, Bear has remained conservative.But, at Bear Stearns, asset management, which is separated from the firm's broker dealer by a Chinese wall, executives started an over-leveraged, high-risk fund last August just before the market for subprime loans sank.It was the kind of high-stakes bet that the firm's own proprietary traders would never have made.And while Bear Stearns has said that the asset management unit was separate from the firm's securities division, questions remain as to why there were not sufficient controls in place.The thought of such a bet now angers Cayne, who is the firm's largest individual shareholder with a stake that at the stock's peak was $1.2 billion.""I would have bet against this occurring at Bear Stearns, "" he said.That such an initiative and the attendant meltdown occurred in a business that represents only 6 percent of the firm's revenues has driven senior Bear executives to distraction.The immediate onus has fallen on Marin who was head of asset management and is also likely to hit the funds' manager, Ralph Cioffi. The firm earlier this week shifted its head of mortgages, Thomas Marano, to the asset-management unit to help unwind the funds' investments.But the business also reported to Warren Spector, the longtime co-president, and people inside the firm he, too, was shouldering part of the blame.Cayne declined to comment on who should be held responsible. But he did say that ""there is a lot of pain here.""Bear and Cayne assumed responsibility for the funds' demise by providing a $3.2 billion line of credit, a move that drew the approval of Cayne's peers on Wall Street. Still, many lenders to the hedge fund wondered why the firm did not act sooner, perhaps in April when it became clear that the securities were losing value.With its expertise in the mortgage market, lenders said the firm should have recognized a problem when these highly complex securities began to trade below their par value in the spring.Cayne would not discuss in detail the specifics of the fund's troubles, citing client confidentiality.Nevertheless, the view within the firm is that Bear had no legal obligation to rescue the funds and that the loan agreements made clear that the lenders were transacting with the two funds and not Bear itself. The firm decided to make the secured loan when it became clear that the funds were near collapse and that Bear's image was being damaged.As for whether the recent turmoil might cause Cayne to step down and pass the baton on to one of his co-presidents, either Spector or Alan Schwartz, who oversees investment banking, do not bet on it.""I plan on sticking around, and I will leave when these guys want me to leave,"" he said.Cayne shows no signs of slowing. He has cut out red wine, bacon and salmon for breakfast and the late night deliveries from Bobby Van's steakhouse as part of a regimen to lose weight.

6,"Federal banking regulators set final rules on subprime mortgages yesterday, turning aside banking industry efforts to weaken them.The rules are likely to make it harder for some borrowers to qualify for loans, although many lenders have been tightening their standards in response to rising levels of foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies.The most important change is that financial institutions are told that adjustable-rate mortgages should be given only to borrowers who would qualify to meet the loan terms even after the rate resets higher.That could mean that many borrowers would qualify for loan amounts far smaller than they previously have  making it harder to buy homes and perhaps harder to refinance.In addition, the new rules seek to slow the expansion of so-called liar’s loans, which require little or no documentation of income.Such loans have expanded in recent years, with many banks arguing that the higher rates they get on the loans more than offset the risk of default.The regulators  the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration  have authority over many but not all mortgage lenders, and it is unclear whether the policies will also be adopted by state regulators.The Federal Reserve chose not to use the authority it has under a 1994 law to impose the rules on all mortgage lenders, said Michael D. Calhoun, president of the Center for Responsible Lending, a research and advocacy organization that describes the rules as an “important first step.”“The Fed has historically preferred this kind of guidance, rather than regulations,” Mr. Calhoun said.Regulators said they had grown concerned over the expansion of adjustable rate mortgages for subprime borrowers, both because the borrowers may not understand the risks they are taking and because some “may not have sufficient financial capacity to service a higher debt load, especially if they were qualified based on a low introductory payment.”Under the new rules, a borrower who took out a “2-28” loan, whose interest rate resets in two years, would have to qualify under the assumption that the rate had risen to the level that it would rise to later.As an example, a loan with an initial fixed rate of 7 percent might reset to the six-month London interbank offered rate, known as Libor, plus 6 percentage points. If the Libor rate were 5.5 percent when the loan was made, the borrower would have to have the capacity to meet an 11.5 percent payment.But the regulators rejected a request from some consumer groups to make the rule even stiffer, specifying that a borrower would have to qualify at the highest rate the loan would allow, which in that case could be much more than 11.5 percent, since the Libor rate could rise sharply.“Recognizing that loans to subprime borrowers present elevated credit risk, institutions should verify and document the borrower’s income,” the regulators wrote.“Stated-income and reduced-documentation loans to subprime borrowers should be accepted only if there are mitigating factors that clearly minimize the need for direct verification of repayment capacity,” they added, naming as possible mitigating factors proof the borrower had substantial liquid reserves or a history of meeting similar payments on a loan being refinanced.“However,” the regulators added, “a higher interest rate is not considered an acceptable mitigating factor.”Some banks had voiced fears that requirements to inform borrowers of the options they had amounted to “suitability rules,” similar to those that brokers must meet. A risky investment suitable for a well-paid executive might be unsuitable for an elderly widow with limited resources.The regulators said, however, that they were not seeking to impose a suitability standard, only to assure borrowers they were informed of relevant facts about the costs and risks of mortgages.Yesterday, the mortgage banking industry was far less strident in its opposition to the rules than it was in March, when the regulators sought comment on a draft version.“This is a strong statement that will help curb abuses,” John M. Robbins, chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association, said in its statement, “but will likely also constrain consumer credit choices.”"
7,"THE wonderful world of leverage has lifted homeownership to near-record levels, and we thump our chests with pride at the prosperity and middle-class life that possessing a home implies. Hovering in the background, however, is a glaring statistic: Never before have homeowners actually had such a small ownership stake in the houses they occupy.The reason is debt. Home prices have gone up a lot, but borrowing against homes has gone up even more in almost all of the last 20 years. “Owners’ equity,” as the Federal Reserve calls the difference, is gradually eroding — a detail that millions of families ignore, focusing instead, perversely, on the rising dollar value of their homes.“People believe their homes will continue to appreciate in value,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Economy.com, “so that even if they take out money and reduce their equity, it will all come back very quickly.”When they sell, most still pocket a tidy sum after paying off their loans. But millions of middle-income families don’t sell; they take out another loan, which they often spend, surveys show. And then, as the margin of potential profit — a k a owners’ equity — shrinks, it becomes a little harder for a family to weather an unexpected hardship: an illness, a layoff, a wage cut or a forced early retirement.There is less market value to borrow against in the event of such setbacks and less cash from a forced sale, particularly if the sale comes as home prices are falling, squeezing owners’ equity from the other end.Just such a squeeze appears to be under way as home prices level off and begin to drop. The stake that families have in their homes fell faster in the 12 months through March than at any time since the early 1990s, the Fed reports. At the end of the first quarter, the nation’s homeowners owned, free of debt, only 52.7 percent of their dwellings, down from 54.1 percent a year earlier and 57.5 percent at the start of the century. The decline occurred even though owners’ equity, measured in dollars, rose by an astonishing $4.3 trillion since 2000. Unfortunately, mortgage debt rose by $5 trillion.“Basically people are gradually consuming their capital,” said Edward N. Wolff, an economist at New York University who studies household wealth. “It makes the middle class in particular more vulnerable. Their homes are still their biggest saving, and that is the bottom line.”Even now, the illusion of rising equity obscures its erosion. For a family with a $50,000 mortgage and a house valued at $100,000, for example, the owner’s equity is 50 percent. Two years pass. The family borrows an additional $60,000, raising debt secured by the house to $110,000. The expected selling price, however, has risen to $200,000. True, the ratio of equity to value has fallen to 45 percent, but in a sale, the family would pocket $90,000, after paying off debt. That is nearly double the cash it would have collected two years earlier.Home prices, however, must continue to climb for this merry process to continue. Indeed, millions of homeowners seem confident that they will do exactly that over the long run, despite the drop in recent months. After all, home prices have risen in most of the country for most of the last 30 years, the exceptions being the late 1980s through the early 1990s — and, perhaps, now.Even if prices continue to fall, homeowners are likely to cut their borrowing only slowly and reluctantly, if the last year’s behavior is a guide. Using one’s home as an A.T.M., as economists like to say, has become so easy since the 1980s that it is hard to kick the habit. Home equity loans proliferated, giving families a readily available line of credit, and government encouraged lenders to reach out to low-income families, allowing them to qualify for mortgages with little (sometimes no) down payment. Mortgage lenders shed their caution, able to sell sketchy home loans on Wall Street and pass on their default risk to other investors (the perils of which have been exposed in the recent Bear Stearns debacle).The tax code has played its own special role in all of this. Congress changed the law in 1986, allowing individuals to deduct on their tax returns only those interest payments on loans tied to housing. Interest on other loans no longer qualified. With that big change, borrowing against one’s home to buy a car or an appliance or clothing or a vacation became cheaper, after taxes, than standard consumer credit.“What surprises me,” said Lee Price, chief economist for the House Appropriations Committee, “is that more people haven’t mortgaged higher percentages of their equity.”Low-income families, just scraping by, certainly have mortgaged their equity, qualifying for subprime mortgages that require very little down payment. The adjustable interest rates on these loans are now a problem. As rates rise, many poor families can no longer afford the monthly payments, or they are falling behind and into foreclosure, making the subprime crisis headline news.Subprime borrowers, however, are too few to be the major reason for the nationwide decline in owners’ equity. That honor, Mr. Wolff says, goes to a vast number of middle-class families with incomes of up to $150,000 a year and net worth of up to roughly $420,000.The culture of “own your home free of debt as soon as possible” had endured for decades. Through the 1960s and ’70s, owners’ equity ranged from 65 to 70 percent. As recently as 1983, some 52 percent of American homeowners who were 55 to 65 years old owned their homes without any mortgage debt — allowing them to be free of monthly installment payments during their retirement years. By 2004, however, that percentage had dropped to 36 percent, according to Federal Reserve data.The first sharp decline in owners’ equity — nearly three percentage points — came in 1990 as home prices dropped while borrowing held strong. The decline then continued, despite the housing boom, although at a slower pace — a fraction of a percentage point annually during most years. And then last year, another steep drop in equity kicked in, as home prices weakened but owners kept up their borrowing.“You might end up without enough pension income to pay off your mortgage, or enough equity to draw on if health costs get out of hand,” said Conrad Egan, president of the National Housing Conference. “But people seem to be saying, “O.K., I’m willing to live in that kind of environment.’ ”"
8,"NEW YORK —With the U.S. housing market in decline, financial predators are finding yet another way to take advantage of people who fall behind on their payments.The schemes take various forms and often involve promises to distressed homeowners of cash up front, free monthly rent and a chance to retain their houses in the long run. But in the process, someone else takes over the deed, borrows as much as possible against the value of the house and pockets the cash. And, almost always, the homeowners still end up losing their homes.There are no nationwide numbers on this common fraud, known as equity stripping, but it has turned up in almost every state. Seven states have passed laws to try and stop it. Still, with foreclosure rates rising rapidly, it will be a growing problem, consumer advocates say.""Conditions now are perfect for these scams,"" said Lauren Saunders, managing attorney at the National Consumer Law Center in Washington. ""We are at the end of a period of rising real estate prices, so a lot of people have equity in their homes. But we also have a foreclosure crisis.""Gloria and Fred Johnson fell for a sales pitch that they now regret. They had secured their version of the American dream - a home of their own - in the Bushwick section of Brooklyn in 2001.For three years, they had scrimped to save the $8,000 down payment for a house. They took out a $226,000 mortgage backed by the Federal Housing Administration. But in 2004, an injury forced Johnson, 38, to take a leave from her counseling job at Fountain House, an advocacy group that works with the mentally ill.She struggled financially on disability payments and her husband's income as a construction worker. By the summer of 2004, they had fallen two months behind on their mortgage.So Johnson called Home Savers Consultants, a Brooklyn company that advertised help for people facing foreclosure. ""I saw the advertisement in a local paper,"" she recalled. ""I was in a tight situation and was scared to death I was going to lose my house.""Because the Johnsons' home had risen in value, they could have sold it and paid off about $275,000 in debt. But they wanted to remain in the house.Johnson met with Home Savers officials and agreed to what she thought was a refinancing of her loan at a lower interest rate with more affordable monthly payments. But the Johnsons unknowingly transferred their deed to a straw buyer working with Home Savers, court documents contend.That stand-in buyer qualified for a type of mortgage that would let him take cash out as part of the financing. He borrowed $425,000 against the house and pocketed $134,000, which included the equity the Johnsons had built up over the years. Now the Johnsons are fighting to stay in their house and to recover their equity.Jessica Attie, co-director of the foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services and the lawyer who represents the Johnsons, said her office was overwhelmed with homeowners who had handed over their deeds to people pretending to help ""save"" their homes.Officials at Home Savers could not be reached; the company's telephone has been disconnected.Foreclosure schemes have attracted the attention of legislators, and at least seven states have created laws against them. In February, the state of New York instituted the Home Equity Theft Prevention Act, which provides legal recourse to victims. And last month, the Massachusetts attorney general, Martha Coakley, banned for-profit mortgage rescue schemes from the state after a slew of complaints.Victims are becoming more plentiful as homeowners fall behind on their payments and find that they cannot refinance with mortgage rates rising. The Mortgage Bankers Association recently disclosed that nearly 19 percent of all loans to less-creditworthy consumers, or 1.1 million mortgages, were either delinquent by more than 30 days or in foreclosure. At the end of 2006, the figure among these subprime loans was 17.9 percent.When a property enters foreclosure, it appears on a list at the county clerk's office. Individuals and companies in equity-stripping schemes monitor the lists closely, contacting troubled homeowners by phone, by mail or by knocking on their doors.These companies advertise heavily in target areas. ""Are you losing sleep because of mounting debt and harassing bill collectors?"" asked one flier from ""foreclosure specialist"" Equitable Real Estate Solutions.Aleem Morris, 30, who lost his job as a forklift operator three years ago, answered that flier. Behind in his mortgage payments on a two-story home in the Vailsburg neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, where he lived with his ailing 82-year-old grandfather, Morris was desperate. He had borrowed money from family and friends, but the house went into foreclosure in February 2005. He owed $118,000.Morris said he met with Kenneth McKinnon, an official at Equitable Real Estate, and told him that he had bad credit, no job and was losing his house.According to Morris, McKinnon said those troubles could vanish. Under a complex arrangement, Equitable would arrange for someone else to buy the house - temporarily, as it was explained to him. In return, Morris would receive $20,000 in cash and someone else would make monthly payments while he and his grandfather lived there for a year. Along the way, the monthly payments would be made in Morris's name, repairing his credit, so that he could qualify for a new mortgage.The house was sold for $315,000. Records show that in May 2006, Morris received his cash, and that his debts, including a tax lien and outstanding mortgage payments, were paid.But the remaining $127,199, which probably represented his equity in the house, went to a mysterious ""construction note"" that Morris said he knew nothing about. McKinnon told Morris that to make the deal work, a lot of people had to get paid.In October, Morris was informed that his house was again in foreclosure. He started looking for a lawyer. Essex-Newark Legal Services is now handling his case.""I had no idea what I was doing,"" Morris admitted, saying that his grandfather would suffer the most. With the promise of quick money, repaired credit and a place to live without paying rent for a year, he was easily tempted. ""Who wouldn't take a deal like that?""McKinnon answered his phone, but declined to discuss the case. He did not return subsequent messages.Foreclosure rescue deals vary in execution, but as Morris's case shows, they capitalize on two things: borrower desperation and mind-bogglingly complex mortgage loan documents. A study published earlier this month by the Federal Trade Commission found that documents were so confusing that nine out of 10 borrowers could not identify upfront fees on mortgage loans and half could not specify the amount they were borrowing.Kareem Fahim and Julie Creswell contributed reporting."
9,"WASHINGTON, July 17 (AP) — Federal and state banking regulators said yesterday that they would step up their scrutiny of lenders that make home loans to people with shaky credit, focusing on companies that operate outside federal banking oversight.The pilot program, announced by the Federal Reserve, two other federal agencies and state banking officials, is scheduled to start in the fourth quarter and affect about 12 lenders. It will be set up to examine companies that account for the majority of subprime loans, a category that has experienced a surge of defaults in recent months.Problems in the subprime market first emerged in February, when the lenders HSBC Holdings and the New Century Financial Corporation reported mounting payment defaults.Many subprime lenders have since gone bankrupt or have been sold. Foreclosures were up 87 percent last month from a year ago, a real estate information company, RealtyTrac, said last week.The announcement of the program came one day before the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was scheduled to give the central bank’s midyear economic forecast to Congress. Lawmakers have criticized the Fed for lax regulation of the mortgage market before the problems came to light.Last month, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, threatened to strip the Federal Reserve of its authority to write rules against mortgage abuses if the central bank did not act quickly. And Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and a presidential candidate who heads the Senate Banking Committee, said in May that a “chronology of regulatory neglect” allowed the problems in the subprime market to go unchecked.Only about a quarter of subprime loans in 2005, the most recent year available, were made by federally regulated banks, according to the Fed. The other 75 percent were made by state-licensed lenders and subsidiaries of federally regulated banks that operate with limited federal regulation.The agencies said they would coordinate reviews of lenders and mortgage brokers to make sure they comply with consumer protection laws, as well as evaluate the lenders’ underwriting standards.In a joint statement, the agencies said they would “initiate appropriate corrective or enforcement action as warranted by the findings of the reviews or investigations.”Other participants in the pilot project are the federal Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission and state agencies, which are represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators.Regulators in 26 states have pledged to adopt lending standards similar to those adopted last month by federal banking regulators. The standards call on lenders to evaluate strictly a borrower’s ability to repay a home loan and to include consumer protections."

11,"After two years of rapid-fire deal making, private equity firms are finding it harder to get the job done.Some 15 to 20 debt offerings — analysts’ estimates vary — have been modified or postponed as anxious investors have demanded better terms for high-yield loans and bonds, the lifeblood of the leveraged buyout. Private equity firms have had to raise interest rates and sweeten the repayment — or risk having to withdraw the offerings entirely.“It’s the issuers who are over a barrel right now,” said Justin B. Monteith, an analyst with the research firm KDP Investment Advisors. “The market could go lower as people see how far they can push the issuers.”Anxiety over securities backed by risky mortgage loans and rising interest rates has roiled the credit markets for several months. Now the contagion from those troubles seems to be spreading into other parts of the marketplace. After edging past the 14,000 mark on Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average closed yesterday at 13,851.08, down 149.33 points, in part because of continued concern about subprime mortgages.The yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell below 5 percent yesterday, closing at 4.95 percent, in another sign that investors are looking for safe havens.This week, the sale of loans meant to finance the buyouts of the Chrysler Group and the European retailers Alliance Boots and Maxeda have been sweetened or postponed. Bond sales have not fared much better: about $3.65 billion in offerings have been postponed since June 26, according to data from KDP.If conditions do not improve, private equity firms and their bankers may face an even uglier situation. Some $235 billion in loans are waiting to be sold, nearly all for leveraged buyouts, according to Standard & Poor’s Leveraged Commentary and Data.Nearly all major debt offerings that were expected to take place next month have been pushed back. First Data, a credit card processor whose $22 billion sale of loans and bonds is widely seen as a bellwether for the high-yield credit markets, has pushed back its offering until after Labor Day. Bankers for other major buyouts, like TXU’s, may hold off their debt sales even longer.In short order, one of the friendliest environments that private equity firms have seen in years has quickly grown hostile. Once they could command extraordinarily lenient terms from investors, making the debt used to fuel leveraged buyouts quite cheap. So-called covenant-lite loans, which have few restrictions on repayment, blossomed, as did pay-in-kind toggles, bonds that could be repaid by issuing more debt.Now, analysts say, investors have shunned that easy debt, forcing buyout firms to pay more to get their deals done.This week, Chrysler raised the interest rates on $18 billion in loans meant to finance its buyout by Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity and hedge fund firm, Mr. Monteith said. The two sets of loans, earmarked for the carmaker itself and for its financing unit, may now cost the company millions more in interest payments.Two companies being acquired by the private equity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts also postponed debt offerings amid the tougher market conditions. Alliance Boots, a British pharmacy chain, reportedly delayed £9 billion (or $18.5 billion) in loans. The chain is also said to be considering raising the interest rates on those loans.And Maxeda, a Dutch department store retailer, also canceled an offering of 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion). It is not clear when either company will reschedule those sales.The troubles in the loan market have followed similar struggles to sell high-yield bonds. Over the last month, companies like U.S. Foodservice, a major provider of food to restaurants and school cafeterias, and ServiceMaster International, a lawn care and pest control services provider, have had to cancel bond offerings totaling almost $2 billion.To sell $1.175 billion in bonds to finance its buyout last month, Dollar General removed an additional $725 million in toggles.Buyout firms are not the only ones suffering from the growing wave of caution sweeping through the markets. An increasingly popular practice among banks has been to assume part of the equity of these deals in what is known as an equity bridge. Banks normally turn around and sell off these portions to other investors. But at least two times over the past month, in the deals for U.S. Foodservice and ServiceMaster, banks have been stuck on the bridge.“I hope they go the way of the dinosaur,” James Dimon, JPMorgan Chase’s chief executive, said in a conference call on Thursday.Mr. Dimon has reason to sound alarmed. His bank is providing a $500 million bridge for TXU’s buyout by Kohlberg Kravis and TPG Capital; Citigroup is also providing $500 million.Later on in the call, Mr. Dimon sounded less worried. “There are some hung bridges, again nothing on our balance sheet we are particularly concerned about,” he said. But the consequences of being stuck on a bridge are serious. The more banks’ hands are tied with these loans, the less money they have to make additional loans to other deals.One private equity firm that is particularly at risk if credit starts to dry up is Kohlberg Kravis. It is exposed to at least six deals that have been delayed, modified or canceled in the last month. The firm filed to go public earlier this month.The tighter credit markets may not choke off deal making. But, analysts say, private equity must be willing to pay a higher price."
12,"HEDGE fund managers are not short on chutzpah, as a rule. But it takes a special kind of cheek to ask investors at this very tender moment in the housing market for $750 million to fund a new company specializing in subprime residential mortgage loans.Michael W. Vranos, celebrity bond trader and founder ofEllington Management,has that audacity. And then some.Mr. Vranos oversees $5.4 billion in hedge funds and private accounts, and an additional $1.2 billion in a managed account, while also managing almost $23 billion in collateralized debt obligations (pools of loans backed by assets like home loans or credit card debt).That might be enough to keep others busy. But Mr. Vranos is also peddling shares in a new entity calledEllington Financial LLC. An offering statement, dated July 12, began circulating on Wall Street last week; it is a private placement aimed solely at institutional investors, like pension funds and insurance companies. Friedman Billings Ramsey is the underwriter.On its face, it may sound like a promising deal for speculators. Subprime loans are in the tank, as everyone knows. Surely there is money to be made picking up distressed properties for pennies on the dollar.And isn’t Mr. Vranos one of the world’s leading experts on mortgage securities? The Ellington prospectus certainly confirms this. “He was praised during the difficult bear market of 1994 by Jack Welch, chairman of Kidder Peabody’s parent company, General Electric,” it noted, “who said that Mr. Vranos ‘has done a better job than 99 percent of the managers at G.E. at managing a cycle.’ ”When Mr. Vranos was head of the mortgage securities trading desk at Kidder Peabody back in the early 1990s, Fortune magazine called him “one of the best bond traders on Wall Street,” the filing boasts.The filing is silent, however, on a near calamity Mr. Vranos had with his fund during the financial crisis of 1998. When Long Term Capital Management imploded that fall, credit markets seized. Three hedge funds run by Mr. Vranos lost about 25 percent of their value but stabilized after he auctioned $2 billion in securities to meet margin calls.ELLINGTON MANAGEMENT has obviously thrived since then. The filing shows that since 2000, Mr. Vranos has handily beaten the fixed-income average, producing double-digit gains in all those years but two.His performance so far this year is not as stellar. At the end of May, his mortgage-backed credit funds were up 1.8 percent; his “composite” hedge fund return for the period is 3.81 percent.But is now the time to raise $750 million in permanent capital on a subprime spending spree?Subprime mortgage loans are certainly far cheaper now than they were just a few months ago. Still, the shakeout in the industry may have only just begun. Last week, major lenders like Washington Mutual and Countrywide Financial said they would no longer offer the most popular subprime loans, those carrying low two- or three-year fixed rates that then reset to much higher levels. As access to those loans is cut off, subprime borrowers will have greater difficulty refinancing billions in mortgages whose rates are shooting up right now. Defaults are likely to rise, even from today’s high levels.Granted, timing is everything in market matters — and Mr. Vranos certainly has been through his share of up and down cycles.Yet the timing of Ellington Financial’s hoped-for debut is intriguing because it appears to be a way for Mr. Vranos to unload subprime assets he bought a few months ago at higher prices than they would likely fetch today on investors.Some $70 million of the offering’s proceeds is expected to go toward buying equity in something calledSpyridon Holdings,which owns a real estate investment trust that Mr. Vranos’s management company formed in May 2007. It bought $345 million of the riskiest portions of mortgage pools, known as equity residuals, issued by theNew Century FinancialCorporation, a subprime lender that declared bankruptcy in April. New Century made the loans from 2003 to 2006, the filing said.The $70 million earmarked from Ellington Financial’s investors to buy those assets will cover about 40 percent of the roughly $170 million Spyridon put up to buy them — it borrowed the rest. In return, Ellington Financial investors will receive 40 percent of Spyridon.But what inquiring Ellington investors should want to know is exactly how those New Century residuals are being valued and whether that amount reflects reality or fantasy.The Ellington prospectus says that the amount to be paid, estimated at $70 million, will be based “on fair market valuations of the New Century residuals provided at the time of purchase by one or more independent third parties.” But Ellington goes on to say that it expects any difference between those valuations and the $345 million purchase price to reflect only whatever cash the assets have distributed to Spyridon since they were bought and “any changes in interest rates over the course of such period.” Some $50 million in cash has been distributed by the New Century residuals, the filing said.No mention is made about the decline since May in the values of subprime loans over all and in New Century loans in particular. Even the lender’s high-grade paper is taking a hit — last week, Standard & Poor’s downgraded by one notch several AAA-rated New Century securities consisting of second lien assets.The problem, traders say, is that residual interests in New Century mortgage securities are not trading, so any valuation of the $345 million stake will likely be based on a model, not a true market. Besides, if the assets were such a good trade for Mr. Vranos, investors might be wondering, why is he sharing that largess?Asked Friday whether the offering is a way to dump poorly performing securities onto investors for a higher-than-market price, Mr. Vranos first said that I should not have obtained a copy of the prospectus because it is a private placement. All he would say about the New Century residuals is: “I don’t know if they’ve declined. I’m not responsible for pricing them — we use third-party pricing. That’s obviously a question that potential limiteds ask all the time. Obviously we have an answer.”Josh Rosner, an authority on mortgage-backed securities at Graham-Fisher, an independent research firm in New York, looked at the Ellington Financial filing details that I forwarded to him. He said: “If you are exposed to significant losses on a mark-to-market basis, your goal is, within the legal framework, to avoid having to take that mark. One of the ways that people are starting to avoid that is to resecuritize assets and put them into other vehicles at par. I think there is a strong chance that may be what’s happening here.”So in addition to jettisoning some of the New Century residuals, the transaction with Ellington Financial may allow Mr. Vranos to value those that he owns elsewhere in his financial empire at a higher price than he otherwise could.Hedge funds are unregulated entities and they want to remain that way. That is fine with me. But transactions like this one seem almost certain to draw scrutiny. And hedge fund managers as smart as Mr. Vranos should know that."
13,"EVEN by the standards of a company that builds everything from light bulbs to power plants and straddles markets as varied as prime-time TV and commercial finance,General Electric’smammoth project along the Hudson River north of Albany is staggering. The company plans to lay down more than 28,000 feet of rail and 267,000 square yards of plastic beside the river’s edge — all to haul nearly 400,000 tons of sediment from the bottom of the Hudson beginning in 2009, seven years and $500 million after G.E. agreed to undertake the job.Except this isn’t one of the huge infrastructure projects that’s driving G.E.’s bottom line these days; it’s a government-mandated cleanup of pollutants the company dumped in the river long ago. It’s also a task that G.E. routinely resisted for decades until Jeffrey R. Immelt, then the rookie chief executive, succumbed to federal pressure and abandoned the combative stance of his predecessor, John F. Welch Jr., and pledged to dredge the Hudson.Toxic mud wasn’t the only mess Mr. Immelt had to clean up when he took the reins from the legendary Mr. Welch in 2001. Along with dealing with a struggling reinsurance unit that forced G.E. to take billions in write-offs, a power turbine business poised to collapse and an overvalued stock, Mr. Immelt had the misfortune to move into the corner office just four days before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks altered the political landscape and the outlook for core G.E. franchises like jet engines and aircraft leasing.A cooler, humbler and more reserved chief executive than Mr. Welch, Mr. Immelt readily acknowledges that the last several years have not been easy.“We’ve had to re-earn the respect of investors,” he said in an interview in G.E.’s Manhattan offices atop 30 Rockefeller Center, home of the company’s troubled NBC Universal franchise. But that’s what happens “when you write off $3 billion on reinsurance, sell stuff, buy things, and the earnings growth rate is 11 percent and it should be 15 percent.”Even so, the clock is ticking. There is growing pressure on Mr. Immelt to do something — anything — to get G.E.’s stock moving after six years of stagnation. Despite a 15 percent rally over the last two months, G.E. shares are still down 30 percent from their Welch-era peak. And in April, the analyst Jeffrey T. Sprague of Citigroup Investment Research stunned Wall Street by calling for a breakup of the company, urging Mr. Immelt to sell off NBC Universal, as well as the consumer finance and real estate units.Mr. Sprague’s call was the equivalent of breaking china in G.E.’s executive dining room, and the company’s top brass took it as a sign that Wall Street was running out of patience. Although NBC looks safe until after the broadcast of the Summer Olympics next year, Mr. Immelt is vowing to be “tough-minded and investor-friendly” in evaluating G.E.’s myriad holdings, while swearing off big acquisitions for the rest of this year.No one expects Mr. Immelt, 51, to be forced out of the top job, but the longer the stock stays underwater the greater the likelihood that he will have to take the kind of drastic action that analysts like Mr. Sprague are urging.All of which is reasonable: corporations hire C.E.O.s to make both prescient and hard choices. But Mr. Immelt faces a more complex challenge than his predecessors. Whereas Mr. Welch took over a company vulnerable to foreign competition and hamstrung by a bloated work force (and cut so many jobs that he earned the unwelcome sobriquet Neutron Jack), Mr. Immelt took over a giant that had been successful but wasn’t growing as fast as smaller, more agile companies — and which had a number of financial and operational time bombs in its portfolio.“Five years ago, we had troubled franchises and no liquidity,” Mr. Immelt says. “Think about being in the aircraft leasing and aircraft engine business on September 12.”To reinvigorate the corporate behemoth that is G.E., Mr. Immelt has made more than $75 billion worth of acquisitions in sectors like energy, aviation, water treatment and health care while selling off the division where he and Mr. Welch both began their careers, GE Plastics, for $11.6 billion in May. The result, says Mr. Immelt, “is that the company in every way is different than it was in 2001.”Maybe so, but investors don’t seem especially grateful. Even worse, shares of its archrival and Connecticut neighborUnited Technologieshave nearly doubled over the same period. So while the environmentalists who panned his predecessor — not to mention the employees who feared Mr. Welch — might vastly prefer Mr. Immelt, there is one group that still longs for the days of Neutron Jack: Wall Street analysts and institutional investors whose respect Mr. Immelt is desperately seeking before the calls for a breakup become too loud to ignore.“There’s no drop-dead date, but he’s going to hit his six-year anniversary,” says Mr. Sprague, the Citigroup analyst. “If the stock doesn’t move, people will get more agitated.”For his part, Mr. Immelt is either too smart or too loyal to blame Mr. Welch for his troubles. “It is what it is,” he says. “He couldn’t have seen 9/11 coming.” Mr. Immelt has spent almost his entire 25-year career at G.E. and Mr. Welch’s legacy has clearly left an impression.“Jack Welch’s track record was phenomenal,” says Mr. Immelt, his voice slowing and growing deeper with emotion. “I’ve had the opportunity to know hundreds of C.E.O.’s, and there’s still not one I admire more than him.”Although Mr. Welch proclaims himself “totally satisfied” with Mr. Immelt’s performance, he doesn’t hide his feelings about G.E.’s slumbering stock. “It’s disappointing to all of us — ‘frustrated’ is the word I’d use,” he says in his trademark Boston rasp. “It’s below where it was when I left, but I haven’t sold.”Mr. Welch vehemently disputes the notion that Mr. Immelt has been forced to clean up a financial mess, and he is equally adamant in his critique of calls to break up the company.“It would be a tragedy of enormous proportions,” he says. “When you start talking like that, it’s surrender.”OFFICIALLY, the Welch era at G.E. lasted 20 years, from the April day in 1981 when Mr. Welch took over from his predecessor, Reginald H. Jones, until he retired on Sept. 6, 2001. In reality, however, General Electric and Jeffrey Immelt are only now emerging from both Mr. Welch’s shadow as well as what some people call the perfect storm that enveloped the 129-year-old company during the first half of this decade.Last week, after a solid second-quarter earnings report, G.E. shares hit a five-year high of $40.95, though still a far cry from the $60 level reached in 2000. Revenues came in at $42 billion, $1 billion higher than some analysts expected, enough to deliver the mid-teens percentage earnings growth Mr. Immelt has been promising Wall Street but failed to deliver last year. And environment-focused investors who wouldn’t dream of buying G.E. stock under Mr. Welch are full of praise for Mr. Immelt’s new “Ecomagination” initiative and are now eyeing it as a suitable investment.“I feel like we now have control over our own destiny for the first time in the last few years,” Mr. Immelt says. “There’s no headwind.”Whether Mr. Immelt can keep his company’s rebound on course has consequences that will extend far beyond 30 Rock or G.E.’s headquarters in Fairfield, Conn. That’s because G.E. has always been more than just another company in the Fortune 500, where it ranked sixth last year after earning $20.8 billion on revenue of $168 billion. With six main divisions — commercial finance, infrastructure, industrial, consumer finance, health care, and entertainment and media — G.E. has long been a proxy for the overall health of corporate America.And anything that hurts the nation’s economy usually takes its toll on G.E. as well. The current crisis in subprime mortgages, for example, is underscored by a $500 million hit to earnings G.E. absorbed in the first half of the year.The company has long served as a C.E.O. boot camp and fertile territory for executive recruiters. Among headhunters, snaring a top G.E. name is akin to winning an Oscar; the runner-up to succeed Mr. Welch, W. James McNerney Jr., left G.E. to take over 3M and is now the chief executive of Boeing. (Robert L. Nardelli, another former G.E. star, went on to run Home Depot, but that’s another story.)G.E.’s raw scale and visibility, and the regal status accorded to past holders of the top job, put Mr. Immelt into a very exclusive club. He’s only the 12th man to hold the position since Thomas Edison founded G.E. Indeed, it can be lonely at the top, but Mr. Immelt has sought advice from Warren Buffett, the renowned investor and chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway. He says he also regularly dines with fellow C.E.O.’s like Kenneth Chenault of American Express, Samuel Palmisano of I.B.M. and William Weldon of Johnson & Johnson.Unlike Mr. Buffett, though, Mr. Immelt isn’t a hero to investors these days. And while Mr. Welch says “my anticipation when I recommended Jeff for the job is that it would be 20 years and I see nothing that would change it,” the reality is that things have changed.The rise of hedge funds as well as activist investors and private-equity buyers all mean that even the likes of Jeffrey Immelt have to worry more about the next quarter rather than the next quarter-century. “If it weren’t for its size, you’d have to consider G.E. a premier go-private candidate,” says one top banker who requested anonymity because he works closely with G.E.Unlike Mr. Welch, Mr. Immelt acknowledges that time isn’t unlimited. “Nobody is guaranteed 20 years,” he says. “Not me. Not anyone else.”So if the heat is on, why not break up the company? Or at least sell off noncore units like NBC Universal or the consumer finance unit, GE Money, which would not only raise billions but also make this colossus a heck of a lot easier for one man to manage? After all, Mr. Sprague says, “when you visualize G.E., you’re thinking about the meat and potatoes: power, aircraft engines, energy. You might get comfortable with GE Money, but hardly anyone is buying the stock because of GE Money.”In defending their stance, Mr. Immelt and other current executives don’t fall back on Mr. Welch’s no-surrender, last-man-standing rhetoric. Instead, they make a more subtle argument against breaking up the company: Not only does being a conglomerate help G.E. ride out the inevitable ups and downs of the economic cycle, it also creates those elusive synergies that most other companies only talk about.For example, G.E.’s sponsorship of the Summer Olympics in Beijing next year has given G.E.’s infrastructure unit a leg up in winning lucrative orders for locomotives and power turbines from Chinese buyers, according to G.E. executives. What’s more, says John G. Rice, the head of G.E.’s infrastructure division, managers are expected to reach across and work with colleagues in far-flung parts of the company. In fact, they don’t have much of a choice.“If you’re reluctant to do it,” Mr. Rice says, “we’re going to have a sit-down.”IN his understated way, Mr. Immelt is emphatic about G.E’s strength as a conglomerate, underscoring the long-term thinking that’s made G.E. the only original member of the Dow Jones industrials to retain its place in the index. But in the end, the only way for Mr. Immelt to win the argument and keep both his job and the company whole is for G.E.’s shares to move higher. As Steve Tusa, who covers G.E. for JPMorgan Chase, says: “The bottom line in this business is stock price performance.”Short of a breakup, observers like Mr. Tusa say Mr. Immelt has to focus on the company’s huge infrastructure business, G.E.’s largest division in terms of revenue. “Infrastructure is carrying the company and that’s a good thing,” says Mr. Tusa, citing surging orders for locomotives, power turbines, jet engines and other big-iron products that boast fat margins and lucrative long-term service contracts. “That’s why you buy G.E., and he needs to keep that up.”At the same time, G.E. must continue to cut costs at struggling divisions like NBC, which remains stuck in last place among the big four networks in prime time. And with consumer finance showing earnings growth of less than 10 percent, shedding it might not be such a bad idea. “It has limited synergies with the rest of the portfolio,” Mr. Tusa says.Mr. Immelt must also demonstrate what analysts politely term “disciplined capital allocation” — that is, not overpaying for acquisitions. In the two months after G.E.’s announcement in January that it was spending $8.1 billion for Abbott Laboratories’ diagnostic unit, G.E. shares fell 10 percent, causing $40 billion worth of market capitalization to evaporate. In mid-July, Mr. Immelt abandoned the Abbott deal and appeased investors with an expanded $14 billion share buyback.Analysts say that’s the kind of shareholder-friendly approach that enabled Mr. Welch to reign for 20 years at G.E., and they say it’s something Mr. Immelt needs to emulate if he is to repeat that run.ONE of the perks of retirement for C.E.O.’s is not having to court — or bully — Wall Street analysts. So when the subject of Mr. Sprague’s report about breaking up G.E. is raised, Mr. Welch dismisses it outright. “That talk is short-term analyst talk,” he barks. “I heard it from 1981 on, when I first got in there.”Not one to bark, the 6-foot-4 Mr. Immelt is preternaturally relaxed and affable. He has always been like that, acquaintances say. Mr. Immelt played intramural basketball with another future chief executive, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, at Harvard Business School and he jokes that Mr. Dimon was the one who yelled during hoop games. Longtime associates can’t recall Mr. Immelt ever raising his voice, unlike the famously temperamental Mr. Welch.Although no one disputes Mr. Welch’s success as a manager — G.E. shares rose a stunning 4,000 percent over the course of his 20-year tenure — working for him could be brutal. Jerome L. Dodson, president of Parnassus Investments, a money management firm that screens for socially responsible stocks, even cites Mr. Welch’s hard-nosed management style as one of the reasons his firm wouldn’t invest in G.E. “The company wasn’t a good place to work in our opinion,” Mr. Dodson says. (He is now eyeing the shares.)While Mr. Welch was obsessed with internal productivity gains, Mr. Immelt is more focused on sales and marketing, says one former associate.“He puts a bigger spotlight on a different crowd,” says David Calhoun, who ran G.E.’s infrastructure business before leaving last September to run Nielsen, the market research giant. “With Jeff, the worst possible thing is if you lose a sale and you don’t feel bad about it.”Even so, it’s clear that the new regime is kinder and gentler. “Jeff probably lets the conversation go on longer then Jack did,” says Lorraine Bolsinger, a 26-year company veteran who heads G.E.’s new Ecomagination project, which seeks to develop more efficient products that will both help the environment and better serve customers. “You always feel it’s worth a shot to make your point. There’s no fear that if I suggest something or take a risk, I’ll be ridiculed.”Given his stance on cleaning up the Hudson and on other environmental hot buttons, it’s hard to conceive of Ecomagination under Mr. Welch. It has its roots in a 2004 “growth playbook” session, the annual ritual in which G.E. managers outline a three- to five-year growth strategy. Customers were concerned about global warming and carbon dioxide emissions, and also eager to save money on energy costs, Ms. Bolsinger recalls.“Jeff’s view was that we could use this to our advantage or be at the mercy of it,” she says. “And that’s a place we never want to be.”The Ecomagination line now features 45 products with $12 billion in sales. Although skeptics might look upon Ecomagination as the latest version of corporate “greenwashing,” it has impressed socially conscious investors with memories of Mr. Welch.“G.E. used to be stuck in the past,” says Bennett Freeman, senior vice president for social research and policy at the Calvert Group, an investment company. “But the effect of G.E. and Ecomagination is huge. When G.E. commits to renewable energy, the argument is over in corporate America.”Mr. Immelt and Ms. Bolsinger say that the point of Ecomagination isn’t to save the planet but to make money. And the best evidence that G.E. can do both lies in a windowless Greenville, S.C., plant that is the largest gas turbine factory in the world.Alongside huge gas-fired turbines destined for Saudi Arabia — half of G.E.’s overall revenue comes from overseas customers, and the Middle East in particular is booming — workers are busy assembling ultra-efficient wind turbines as quickly as they can get the components. Since G.E. acquired the wind unit from Enron after it went bankrupt in 2001, annual sales have grown to more than $4 billion from $500 million, and the $2 million machines are nearly sold out until late 2009. The wind turbines contain some 8,000 different parts, says Frank Ferraro, a manager at the plant, “but we can do the final assembly in less than a week.”G.E.’s success in Greenville is an impressive example of its prowess when it comes to sophisticated manufacturing, as well as a sign that Ecomagination is more than just another slogan.Ultimately, however, the kind of green initiative that Wall Street cares about most can’t be measured in carbon emissions or employee accolades, but in dollar signs. If Mr. Immelt has any doubt about that, all he has to do is consult the first of Mr. Welch’s six rules for successful leadership: “Control your destiny, or someone else will.”"
14,"DETROIT, July 25  Bankers have been unable to raise all of the money needed for a buyout of the Chrysler Group by the private-equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, but officials at the automaker’s parent company said today that the deal remains on track.For now, the banks working with Chrysler plan to take on the debt themselves and try selling it to investors later, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said.The snag is a result of investors’ unwillingness to accept the terms for $12 billion in loans and does not jeopardize the deal, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the discussions with investors are confidential. The loan proceeds are intended to finance Chrysler’s purchase and restructuring and its investment in new products.JPMorgan Chase is leading the group of banks trying to market the debt to institutional investors.Cerberus has agreed to buy 80.1 percent of Chrysler for $7.4 billion and additional investment in the company over the next few years. The New York-based firm plans to take ownership of its stake in early August, this person said.Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, the German carmaker that has owned Chrysler since 1998, said today that the buyout was moving ahead. “We are completely within the anticipated time schedule for the closing,” he said on a conference call to announce the company’s second-quarter earnings. DaimlerChrysler said profits nearly doubled at Mercedes, to $1.65 billion, but it did not release Chrysler’s performance pending the sale to Cerberus.“The deal will be closed in the third quarter,” a DaimlerChrysler spokesman, Han Tjan, said in a telephone interview. “It shouldn’t be too long from now. Everything is on track.”On Friday, Chrysler’s chief executive, Thomas W. LaSorda, said the deal is “very, very close” to being completed. “The commitments are there from the banks,” he told reporters after a ceremony signifying the start of contract negotiations with the United Automobile Workers union.A Cerberus spokesman, Peter Duda, said, “The transaction will close on schedule,” but declined to comment further.When DaimlerChrysler considered bids for Chrysler this spring, Cerberus was the only investment group that was willing to close the deal before there was a labor agreement, people who took part in the bidding process say. They insisted on anonymity because of the sensitivity of the talks.Cerberus’s willingness to finalize the deal before a new U.A.W. agreement was most likely a factor in DaimlerChrysler’s decision to accept the bid, these people theorize. The U.A.W.’s contract with the Detroit auto companies expires Sept. 14.William H. Gross, an influential bund fund manager, predicted recently that Chrysler might have difficulty raising funds because problems in the home mortgage market have made debt investors wary.“Those that assert that this is merely an isolated subprime crisis should observe very closely the price and terms that lenders are willing to accept with Chrysler finance this week,” Mr. Gross wrote on the Web site of his firm, Pimco. “That more than anything else may wake them, shake them, and tell them that their world has suddenly changed.”Even before the deal is finalized, Chrysler has begun removing the “Daimler” name from some signs at its headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich., and it is planning a celebration for its employees and dealers to commemorate the company’s return to American ownership.Chrysler is expected to bring back the “Pentastar” logo that it used before the merger.“We’re considering it,” said a Chrysler spokesman, Mike Aberlich.Remaining signs and logos will be changed gradually in the coming months.“It takes time to do it and it takes money to do it,” Mr. Aberlich said. “We’re going to concentrate on getting the deal done first.”"
15,"AUBURN HILLS, Mich., July 25 — Bankers have been unable to raise the money needed for the purchase of the Chrysler Group by the private equity firm Cerberus Capital Management, but executives at the automaker’s parent company said on Wednesday that the deal remained on track.The snag is a result of investor unwillingness to accept the terms for $12 billion in loans and does not jeopardize the deal, a person with direct knowledge of the situation said.For now, the five banks, led by JPMorgan Chase, plan to take on about $10 billion of the debt and try to sell it later, said this person, who asked not to be identified because the discussions with investors were confidential. Chrysler and Cerberus will carry the other $2 billion.Chrysler’s financing troubles were among the latest setbacks for private equity firms and banks trying to sell debt used to finance leveraged buyouts.In another deal on Wednesday, bankers for Kohlberg Kravis Roberts withdrew the sale of £5 billion ($10.3 billion) in loans meant to finance the buyout of Alliance Boots, the British pharmacy chain, a person with knowledge of the matter said. The eight banks involved will keep the debt on their books for now. The banks are still trying to sell an additional £1.75 billion in loans after raising the interest rate.Executives in the Chrysler deal were confident on Wednesday that the sale would be completed.“We are completely within the anticipated time schedule for the closing,” said Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of DaimlerChrysler, which has owned Chrysler since 1998.A Cerberus spokesman, Peter Duda, said, “The transaction will close on schedule,” but declined to comment further. Cerberus agreed in May to pay $7.4 billion for the Chrysler Group and invest $5 billion in the company over five years.The automaker is expected to proceed with plans to sell loans for its financing division after raising interest rates.At least 20 debt offerings have been postponed or sweetened as the markets have tightened in recent weeks. Investors have begun to demand better terms for the high-yield loans and bonds at the heart of the leveraged deals.John Casesa, a longtime auto analyst with the Casesa Shapiro Group, said, “I think the market has to reset, correct and find its proper level.”The tightening will become a serious problem for Ford and other companies, Mr. Casesa said, if it is accompanied by a weaker economy, such as slower income growth, higher unemployment, higher inflation and lower consumer confidence.“This puts much more pressure on the management of these companies to execute their operating plan,” Mr. Casesa said, “because they might not have many more financial options.”Cerberus’s difficulty in finding takers for Chrysler debt is a sharp contrast to the situation carmakers faced until recently.In March, Ford Motor sold its Aston Martin sports car brand to private investors for $848 million. In November, Ford tried to raise $18 billion to pay for its revamping and found so many interested lenders that it wound up borrowing $23 billion instead.To be sure, it had attractive collateral. It mortgaged nearly all its domestic assets, including office buildings, patents and even its blue oval logo, and its holdings in Ford Credit and Volvo, the first time in its 103- year history that it had put up its assets in collateral.Likewise, Cerberus beat out Kolberg Kravis Roberts in April for a 51 percent stake in the financing arm of General Motors, G.M.A.C., and had little trouble syndicating $7.5 billion in loans.But early this week, G.M. had to postpone a loan sale to pay for the $5.6 billion buyout of its Allison Transmission unit to the Carlyle Group and the Onex Corporation.“Sentiment changed; it changed on a dime,” said Shelly Lombard, a senior high-yield bond analyst at Gimme Credit. “It’s a 180 from where the market was even six months ago.”Detroit has always been dependent easy access to credit, and tighter restrictions comes at a difficult time — when many in the industry are revamping or seeking financing to exit bankruptcy.The situation could spell trouble for investors who snap up Ford’s Land Rover, Jaguar and Volvo brands, analysts said, although Ford has received plenty of interest in the European car companies.“Plentiful capital is necessary to lubricate Detroit’s restructuring. It’s all that cash that’s enabling deals to get done outside of bankruptcy,” Mr. Casesa said.Auto companies also could have a more difficult time finding investors to help them fund a special trust to take over their employee health care liability, a topic in contract talks with the United Automobile Workers union that began last week. Analysts estimate they may need as much as $70 billion in cash to start the trust.William H. Gross, an influential bond fund manager, had predicted recently that Chrysler might have difficulty raising funds because problems in the home mortgage market have made debt investors wary.“Those that assert that this is merely an isolated subprime crisis should observe very closely the price and terms that lenders are willing to accept with Chrysler finance this week,” Mr. Gross wrote on the Web site of his firm, Pimco. “That more than anything else may wake them, shake them and tell them that their world has suddenly changed.”Mr. Zetsche, the head of DaimlerChrysler, said Wednesday that profit in the second quarter nearly doubled at Mercedes, to $1.65 billion, but it did not release Chrysler’s performance pending the sale to Cerberus.Even before the deal is completed, Chrysler has begun removing the Daimler name from some signs at its headquarters here.Chrysler is expected to bring back the five-pointed star logo that it used before the merger.“We’re considering it,” a Chrysler spokesman, Mike Aberlich, said."
16,"Stock prices tumbled across much of the world today amid worries of slowing economic growth in the United States and more difficult borrowing conditions that could make everything from leveraged corporate buyouts to purchases of new homes more difficult.In the United States, major indexes including the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor’s 500 were down more than 2 percent. It was the worst one-day decline since markets plunged worldwide in late February. Losses were comparable throughout Europe, and larger in many developing countries.“The preconditions for a shock are in place,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com. “Until very recently investors were very nonchalant about risks.”Stock markets have been volatile in recent weeks, as continued strong profits for many companies and an economic boom in Asia have contrasted with signs of slowing in the American economy and new difficulties in borrowing for many that are highly leveraged or have poor credit.Today the Dow plunged 311.50 points, to 13,473.57, while the S.&P. dropped 35.43 points, to 1,482.66. The loss in each case was 2.3 percent. The Nasdaq composite was down 48.83 points, or 1.8 percent, to 2,599.34. Losses of more than 2 percent were recorded in Spain, France and Germany, while Britain, Argentina, Mexico and Brazil fell more than 3 percent.Asian markets fell less, closing before the worst selling began. The plunge came a day after the private equity firm buying Chrysler from DaimlerChrysler said it would complete the transaction despite an inability to borrow the money in credit markets, as had been planned. Banks will hold on to those loans, as they will for a similar deal involving Alliance Boots, a British pharmacy chain. Daimler Chrysler fell $4.11 to $88.91.“There is fear, but not a fear of recession,” said William Gross, the chief investment officer of Pimco, a money-management firm.“The fear is directed toward the question of who will be willing to lend $200 billion to provide takeout financing for previously announced private-equity deals.”The credit difficulties began in the United States with investors growing worried about losses on securities that helped to finance subprime mortgages for borrowers with substandard credit, but now they have spread to highly leveraged companies as well.“The really good times are over,” said Simon Ballard, a global credit strategist at ABN Asset Management in London. “What we have now is a very weak market in terms of credit globally. It will change the environment for higher leverage-type transactions going forward, especially leveraged buyouts.”The credit tightening has come just weeks after the Blackstone Group, one of the largest private equity firms that do leveraged buyouts, went public in a widely anticipated initial public offering. The shares, sold for $31, rose as high as $38 on the first day of trading. Yesterday they traded below $24, but ended the day up 19 cents at $25.70.Even as the stock market has gyrated in recent weeks — with the Dow industrials having alternated rising and falling days over the past eight trading days — financial stocks have been coming under pressure. Citigroup dropped $1.40 to $47.81 yesterday, and is down 9 percent in less than two weeks. Goldman Sachs fell $8.04 to $195.12, and has dropped 12 percent over the same period.The falling stock markets helped turn oil markets lower. After rising above $77 a barrel in early trading — the first time since last summer that level was hit — the nearby crude oil future fell back below $75.Exxon Mobil reported its first earnings decline in years, saying it made $10.3 billion in the second quarter, about $100 million less than in the same period of 2006. Earnings per share were up, due to an aggressive share-repurchase plan, but Exxon stock fell $4.56 to $88.23.American investors were also depressed by a report of slowing sales of new homes, and by reports of losses from homebulders. Beazer fell $1.48 to $15.56, and has now lost two-thirds of its value this year.Beazer faces a criminal investigation for arranging government-guaranteed mortgages for buyers who should not have qualified, but other homebuilders have also plunged. Pulte Homes fell 63 cents to $20.04. and is off about 40 percent this year.Not all stocks were lower. Apple, which lost 8 percent of its value on Tuesday amid fears that its iPhone had not sold as well as expected, has regained all of that loss as it reported strong profits. 3M, which reported record profits, was the only one of the 30 Dow industrials to be up in late trading.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds fell to 4.79 percent from 4.90 percent the day before, as some investors sought safety, but yields rose as prices fell for bonds of lower quality, and some were difficult to sell at all.“We needed to clean house and it’s getting cleaned,” said Kingman Penniman, the president of KDP Investment Advisors, which focuses on high-yield bonds. “It’s the market going from too much liquidity to none. Many of the participants have never seen it.”Standard & Poor’s, in its leveraged commentary report, said the decline in high-yield bond prices this week was the largest since the plunge after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.“It’s pretty clear that this is a big move away from taking risk,"" said Jerry Webman, senior investment officer and chief economist for OppenheimerFunds, a mutual fund company. “People have been borrowing unusually cheaply to buy assets,” Mr. Webman said, “and that whole transaction made sense whether it was houses or companies — if the asset was going to appreciate. But if that asset was not going to appreciate, your loan was not going to work.”The fall in Treasury bond rates has also done little for mortgage rates, Freddie Max reported that the average rate for 30-year mortgage loans was 6.69 percent. Since mid-June, Treasury rates have fallen by half a percentage point, but only a tenth of that move has carried over to the mortgage market.In the past, a sudden seize up of lending has sometimes led to sharp market falls. A leveraged buyout boom in the 1980’s came to a halt when a planned buyout of UAL, the parent of United Airlines, could not be financed. The S.&P. 500 fell 6 percent in one day when that was announced, but regained all the lost ground within 12 weeks.In those days, a financial crisis raised fears of failures for large financial firms. Now, policy makers such as Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, have argued, markets can deal with shocks better today than in the past because risks are more dispersed. Securities backed by risky mortgages that have been a top concern, for instance, are held by pension funds, hedge funds and many other investors around the world. So, they argue, even if the market for those bonds collapses, no major firm is likely to be seriously injured.But the big banks now find themselves taking on more loans because they had promised to do so if the loans could not be sold. And the market for some types of securities has all but vanished. Countrywide Credit, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said this week it would no longer try to sell the riskier mortgage securities that it used to routinely unload. Countrywide fell 82 cents to $29.25, trading at a three-year low.“Everybody now recognizes that the elimination of creative finance in housing leaves us with a problem for new homebuyers,” said Robert Barbera, the chief economits of ITG, because their income is not high enough to buy homes with interest rates and home prices at current levels.“You can make the case that we are simply witnessing a reverse of the late 1990’s — Asia collapse, long-term interest rates swoon and U.S. housing booms,” he added. This time, he said, interest rates may not fall much, due to the Asian boom, and that will put more pressure on housing prices."
17,"HONG KONG, July 27 -- Stock markets across Asia suffered one of the worst days of the year on Friday as contagion spread from a sell-off on Wall Street, but observers were divided over whether the region’s bull run was nearing an end.Few of the region’s markets were spared. South Korea’s Kospi index closed 4.1 percent lower after the biggest sell-off in three years. Also, the Taiex, in Taiwan, fell 4.2 percent; the Singapore Straits Times index fell 3.2 percent; the Nikkei 225 Stock Average in Japan fell 2.4 percent; and the Hong Kong Hang Seng index fell 2.8 percent. The China stock indexes were mainly flat.The worst performers across the region were manufacturers heavily dependent on the U.S. consumer market amid fears over the health of the world’s biggest economy.

20,"FRANKFURT, July 30 (Reuters) — The American subprime mortgage crisis claimed the lender IKB as a first victim in Germany today, setting off sharp falls in other German bank shares on fears that they, too, could face sudden problems.IKB, a small-company lender, surprised markets with a profit warning linked to problems in the American subprime market and announced that its chief executive had stepped down, sending its share price down more than one fifth.IKB’s biggest shareholder, the state bank KfW, stepped in to prop up the bank’s creditworthiness in the wake of the difficulties.But IKB’s exposure to complicated American mortgage investments was the first time the subprime specter had loomed in Europe’s biggest economy. It scared investors, fuelling worries that other German banks could be affected in the same way.Shares in Deutsche Postbank were down 1.2 percent at 55.06 euros by mid-afternoon here, having fallen as low as 52.60 earlier in the session, despite assurances from the company that it would not suffer from the subprime market.An international property financier, Hypo Real Estate, dropped 3.5 percent to 44.71 euros, while Commerzbank was down 2.7 percent at 30.84 euros.Deutsche Bank , which had declined to tell investors about its exact exposure to subprime markets, was down 0.7 percent at 97.25 euros, off a day’s low of 95.85.It will unveil its second-quarter results on Wednesday, and the shares had already tumbled last week on fears of a profit warning.Simon Adamson, an analyst at the credit research firm CreditSights, said that banks had generally failed to explain their obligations stemming from such structured finance deals.“This announcement from IKB will confirm the fears of a lot of investors that we don’t really know what the scale of the problem is,” he said. “If you look through banks’ annual reports you will not find information to tell you what this potential liability is and that is one of the main reasons that the market has been so worried recently.”Mr. Adamson also said that the IKB case showed how quickly subprime problems could get out of control. Just 10 days ago IKB had confirmed its profit goal for the year.But credit rating agencies played down the prospect of ripples from the United States endangering the country’s top-tier banks.“We don’t see any significant impact on the big German banks directly from U.S. sub-prime mortgage problems,” said Stefan Best, an analyst with the rating agency Standard & Poor’s, which recently surveyed big German banks about their exposure.Thomas von Luepke, chief German banks analyst at the ratings agency Fitch, said much depended on whether the American problems spread to the country’s real estate market generally and the United States and European economies.“Most German banks are well-positioned to digest any shock of a limited size,” Mr. von Luepke said.The German financial watchdog BaFin, which oversaw the IKB rescue, said the deal ensured there would be no fallout for the country’s banking system.Default rates on mortgages to high-risk or subprime borrowers in the United States have been creeping up, after years of low interest rates and loosening credit standards.This has led to problems for the banks doing the lending as well as those sharing the risk, culminating in the recent crisis."
21,"Problems in the mortgage market spread deeper and farther afield yesterday.Trading in the shares of a large mortgage company was suspended yesterday, and the nation’s largest insurer of home loans said its stake in a business that underwrites and invests in mortgage securities may be worthless. Earlier, a German bank acknowledged that its investments in American loans have deteriorated.The developments are the latest indications that the housing slump will affect a broader segment of the mortgage industry and that the problems will last longer than many officials had suggested earlier this year. Just last week, the nation’s biggest home lender, Countrywide Financial, acknowledged that defaults on second mortgages to prime borrowers were rising quickly.The New York Stock Exchange never opened trading in shares of American Home Mortgage yesterday after the company said late Friday that it would suspend its dividend and was facing “significant margin calls” from its banks.Already down 70 percent for the year, shares in A.H.M. fell 39 percent in premarket trading, to $6.39.Later in the evening, the Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Corporation, or M.G.I.C., said it would write down its $516 million investment in Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization, or C-Bass, possibly to zero. The Radian Group, which has a $518 million stake in C-Bass, also said it might have to write off its investment completely. The rest of C-Bass is owned by its management.Shares of M.G.I.C. fell about 12 percent in after-hours trading, to $40, and Radian shares fell 8 percent, to $37.Just two weeks ago, C-Bass closed a $184 million acquisition of Fieldstone Investment, which makes and invests in mortgages to homeowners with weak, or subprime, credit. C-Bass also runs Litton Loan Servicing, which processes monthly payments by borrowers and deals with defaulted mortgages.Earlier yesterday, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a bank based in Düsseldorf, Germany, that provides loans to midsize companies, said that investments in American mortgage securities that it had pronounced healthy just 10 days ago had fallen sharply and would be taken over by a German state bank, KfW, which owns 37 percent of IKB. The bank’s chief executive, Stefan Ortseifen, said he would retire.At A.H.M., lenders appear to have issued margin calls on debt that the company used to buy mortgage-backed securities that include its loans and those made by other lenders. At the end of March, the company had borrowed $6.7 billion to finance such investments and had $19.3 billion in liabilities.The company specialized in “Alt-A” loans, which are made to people with good, but not stellar credit. The group falls in between prime and subprime borrowers and often includes investors speculating on rising home prices.“Since the values of the securities have been hit hard in the Alt-A space, that would be a trigger for lenders to hit them with margin calls,” said Zach Gast, an analyst with the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, which is based outside Washington.Officials at A.H.M., which is based in Melville, N.Y., on Long Island, did not return calls for comment or issue a statement in response to the trading of its shares. Its silence helped feed speculation on Wall Street that it was facing a liquidity crisis akin to the ones that caused the demise of New Century Financial and other big mortgage companies earlier this year.In its statement Friday, the company said it would not make the 70 cent dividend on its common stock that it had promised to pay earlier that day. It also suspended the payment of a dividend on two series of preferred shares. The company had $836 million in cash at the end of March.As recently as late June, the company had said it expected to pay a dividend even though it would lose money in the second quarter because of rising delinquencies on its home loans and demands by investors that it buy back defaulted mortgages.Until recently, A.H.M., led by its founder and chairman, Michael Strauss, was one of the fastest-growing and largest mortgage companies in the country. It specialized in adjustable-rate mortgages that in the first few years required borrowers to pay the interest or a minimum payment that was even smaller than that. It caters to homeowners with high credit scores and has an extensive network of retail branches, mortgage brokers and correspondent banks.“The whole industry has looked at them in awe over the last several years,” said Steve Jacobson, president of the Fairway Independent Mortgage Corporation, a lender based in Sun Prairie, Wisc., that has stopped selling loans to A.H.M. while it awaits more information about the company’s financial health.“They have done a phenomenal job,” Mr. Jacobson said. “Michael Strauss is a brilliant man.”At the start of the year, A.H.M. seemed to defy the problems that were plaguing its industry. In the first three months, the company made $16.7 billion in home loans, up 27.2 percent from the same period in 2006.Of all the loans A.H.M. has held for investment, California, Florida, Illinois, Virginia and New York accounted for 46 percent of its loans at the end of March. A third of the mortgages were pay-option loans that allow borrowers to make less than the interest payment on the loan by adding the deferred payments to the principal amount of the loan.Those loans were popular with affluent borrowers and speculators during the housing boom, when rising home prices made them seem safe. Now, however, as home prices fall, defaults are rising.And the fallout from the lending practices appears to be reaching into some unlikely places.The disclosure by IKB that its fund, Rhineland Funding, was having problems stirred credit markets in Europe. Though it is a relatively small bank, investors worried that it might be the first of many others that could find itself in similar circumstances. In recent weeks, hedge funds as far as Australia have suffered big losses because of bets on American mortgage securities.“The question right now is whether it will be solely a crisis for financial markets or for the real economy,” said Jochen Felsenheimer, head of credit strategy at UniCredit in Munich. “The challenge that we are facing is that these crises can be self-fulfilling.”IKB’s stock plunged 4.33 euros, or 20 percent, to 17.50 euros, or $23.96, in Frankfurt. The bank named Günther Bräunig, a managing director at KfW, as its new chief executive.But Stefan Best, a German banking analyst at Standard & Poor’s in Frankfurt, said that his agency’s survey of banks in Europe, the United States and Asia in July showed little worry about subprime-related investments.“So far the banks feel pretty comfortable,” Mr. Best said. “There is a pretty high threshold before they would take a hit.”"
22,"FRANKFURT —The development bank owned by the German government that stepped in this week to protect IKB Deutsche Industriebank from exposure to the U.S. subprime crisis said it had agreed to assume financial obligations from IKB totaling €8.1 billion.The bank, KfW Bankengruppe, made the disclosure, equivalent to $11.1 billion, in a July 30 filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that became public Tuesday.IKB's problems sprang from an apparent funding shortfall at one of its investment vehicles because of exposure to U.S. subprime real estate loans.According to the filing, KfW, which holds a stake of nearly 38 percent in IKB, assumed all of its ""rights and obligations"" to the investment vehicle, Rhineland Funding Capital.On Monday, IKB issued a profit warning, saying it had ""felt the impact of the crisis in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage market."" It said its chief executive, Stefan Ortseifen, had resigned. Ortseifen was replaced by KfW board member Guenther Braeunig.IKB said it could no longer maintain its earnings forecast of €280 million for the 2008 financial year because of its exposure to the subprime loans and said further uncertainty meant access to more financing could be difficult.That sent its shares plunging more than 22 percent on Monday to €16.65. On Tuesday, IKB shares rose 43 cents, or 2.4 percent to close at €18.11.KfW ""deems the average credit quality of the RFCC portfolios to be satisfactory,"" the filing said. ""Even if the credit quality of the RFCC portfolios deteriorates substantially, KfW does not believe that such deterioration would significantly adversely affect either its financial position or liquidity position.""By and large, Europe is thought to be mostly insulated from the crisis among U.S. subprime lenders, who grant mortgages to clients having poor or no credit records. Only one major European bank, HSBC, based in London, has itself made significant subprime loans in the United States.Such loans are virtually unknown on the Continent and limited in scope in Britain, protecting Europe from a similar crisis.But the American banks often sold the loans, which were then converted into tradable bonds linked to the mortgages themselves, and then sold on to other investors."

28,"Deutsche Bank said its second-quarter profit surged 31 percent as its investment banking business proved to be solid amid global market jitters over the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. The bank, based in Frankfurt, earned 1.78 billion euros ($2.44 billion) in the April-June quarter compared with 1.36 billion euros a year earlier and beating the 1.59 billion euros ($2.18 billion) that analysts had predicted. “All our business divisions contributed to this growth,” the chief executive, Josef Ackermann, said. “As a result, we delivered a very strong first half-year.” The results were lifted by sales growth of 29 percent in the bank’s corporate and investment operations, along with a gain of 126 million euros ($172.6 million) from the sale of its former Wall Street offices earlier this year."
29,"NEW YORK —Charles Prince 3rd cannot catch a break.Three weeks ago, the Citigroup chief brushed off concerns that the era of easy money for buyout deals was about to end, optimistic that the banking giant would ""keep dancing.""But as credit problems that started in subprime mortgages have pushed into the broader market, many on Wall Street believe the music has changed. Prince says the recent market pullback ""feels sharp"" but is intent that Citigroup will keep moving.""We see a lot of people on the Street who are scared. We are not scared,"" Prince said during an interview at his office on Park Avenue. ""Our team has been through this before.""Timing has never been Prince's forte. In late July, Citigroup posted its second consecutive quarter of strong results. With signs that his turnaround strategy was working, the company's appeared poised to turn the corner.Then the credit markets collapsed. Citigroup was one of the stock market's worst performers in the month, as all financial stocks sputtered.On Thursday, the company's shares were trading at 46.61, down 24 cents, That is about the price when Prince took over as chief executive in October 2003.""The ultimate measure of a chief executive's performance is company stock price, and on that point, Citigroup has woefully underperformed,"" said Michael Mayo, a banking analyst for Deutsche Bank.Prince, though disappointed with the stock price, was upbeat about the company's direction. ""I think our performance is going to last much longer than the market turbulence does,"" he said during the interview Wednesday.Ever since taking over Citigroup four years ago, Prince has moved from one crisis to the next with little time to gain momentum. He went from stamping out regulatory flames in Europe and Japan to bowing to U.S. regulators in order to lift an unprecedented ban on big acquisitions.He promised heavy investment in the company's ailing businesses, only to watch expenses spiral out-of-control.He appointed a new cost-control czar to shore up his senior management team, only to reshuffle it a month later in the wake of a corporate jet scandal involving a Citigroup executive, Todd Thomson, and a CNBC anchor, Maria Bartiromo.Only recently, Prince has seemed to find his groove. His new finance chief, Gary Crittenden, has been well received both by those inside and outside the company.Executives have said the sweeping corporate overhaul set in motion in April has reversed the trend of expense growth outpacing revenues. Citigroup's North American consumer division is still limping along, but its overseas operations were on a tear. International revenues surged 12 percent from the previous quarter, a sign that the company's overseas push is starting to pay off.""This has been by far the best two quarters for Chuck Prince since he was CEO,"" Mayo said.Prince said he was focused on executing his strategy to reduce costs streamline the company's operations, better connect its sprawling businesses and expand aggressively overseas. But he also introduced a few adjustments, some of which the Citigroup board discussed recently at its annual retreat. For the first time, the board took a comprehensive look at the company and examined its overall direction over the next five years.Internationally, Prince said the company would be more disciplined about where it operated. Instead of sprinkling investments in 100 or so countries, Prince said that Citigroup would focus on only a handful or two or countries where it could build market share.And with more than 60 percent of its revenues expected to come from international operations, Prince expressed a desire for more people from overseas to fill upper management positions and serve on its board.Across Citigroup, Prince said executives were pruning the portfolios of core businesses in order to improve the company's overall return on assets. There are no plans for a major sale or split off. ""This about being smarter, getting things on and off the balance sheet faster, and the velocity of assets - as opposed to changing the configuration,"" he said.Institutionalizing the current cost-cutting effort is another main focus. Earlier this month, the company hired its first chief restructuring officer, who will report to the Citigroup's chief operating officer and identify more places for savings.""Every year, when we do our budget, we want to build into the budget 3 to 5 percent cost reductions,"" Prince said. ""We don't want to wait for a big bang and take a big charge.""But more immediately, Prince faces the challenge of navigating the choppy markets. Investors have grown increasingly concerned that the problems in American subprime mortgage market could spread elsewhere in the economy.More attuned to risks, they turned their backs on the leveraged buyout loans that fueled recent buyout boom. That could force the big banks to sell them at a discounted price, lowering revenue, or choose to carry them on their balance sheets and swallow potentially large write-downs.Only a few weeks ago, Prince played down the prospect of a disruption to the credit markets when he told The Financial Times that the flood of liquidity meant that Citigroup ""was still dancing"" to the music of the buyout boom. Wednesday, his tune changed somewhat as the ""market shakes itself out and probably will for a period of time.""""We have had a period of great liquidity excess,"" Prince said, noting the collateralized debt obligations market that once absorbed the easy financing and loose terms was pretty much shut off. ""What we are seeing now is a pullback into a range of more normal kinds of credit experiences.""""Deals are happening,"" he said. ""Financing is occurring. But it is occurring not in the lax kind of way or excess kind of way but in ways that have been more traditional."""
30,"COOLUM, Australia —World stock and credit markets stabilized Thursday, a day after investors sold shares and high-yielding currencies on fears that trouble in the U.S. mortgage market would trigger a global credit squeeze and hit otherwise robust global growth.Meanwhile, finance ministers from the Asia-Pacific region gathered at the APEC forum here and said they were studying ways to limit repercussions from the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States.A senior International Monetary Fund official attending the APEC meeting said he saw the recent volatility of the financial markets as a healthy sign of a reassessment of risk.While the readjustment in financial markets was painful for some, it was a necessary return to a more appropriate assessment of credit risk by investors, said John Lipsky, first deputy managing director of the IMF.""The realignment of risk,"" Lipsky said, ""is not necessarily unsettling."" He also said that lending conditions had become too easy.Robert Zoellick, president of the World Bank, had a similarly upbeat message. ""The underlying fundamentals for growth and development remain quite strong,"" Zoellick said.""The market was very awash with liquidity, and I think that over the course of the past months and even years that liquidity got channeled into market sentiment,"" Zoellick said. ""That market sentiment outran some of the credit analysis.""Peter Costello, the Australian treasurer and chairman of the 21-country APEC meeting, said that 10 years after the Asian financial crisis, the region was in better shape to weather the latest storm.""We have discussed the risks of global instability and how we can avoid global imbalances affecting the region in adverse ways,"" Costello said.Companies from Taiwan to Australia continue to disclose varying degrees of exposure to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, which has spread to global debt markets and is causing queasiness among investors in Asia, where many local stock markets are still trading near record high levels despite the sell-off Wednesday.Insurance stocks in Taiwan fell Thursday after Taiwan Life Insurance announced a loss on securities backed by subprime mortgages. Cathay Financial and Shin Kong Financial also dropped after they disclosed holdings of collateralized debt obligations containing subprime assets.""Concern about the subprime problem has finally hit home for Taiwan investors,"" said Michael On, a fund manager at Beyond Asset Management in Taipei.Taiwan Life has written off its entire investment in the Bear Stearns High Grade Credit Strategies Fund, it said in a statement. The fund collapsed in July, as did the Bear Stearns High-Grade Structured Credit Strategies Enhanced Leverage Fund.Cathay Financial, owner of the largest life insurer in Taiwan, has invested $1.8 billion Taiwan dollars, or $54.8 million, in collateralized debt obligations containing subprime home loans, according to C.K. Lee, chief strategy officer of the company. Shin Kong, which owns one of the largest life insurers in the country, has invested as much as $11.7 billion in such instruments, Winston Yung, its chief financial officer, said.Bank of China said Thursday that it had booked an ""insignificant"" loss on U.S. subprime securities. The bank had less than 10 percent of its overseas bond investments in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities at the end of 2006, according to Luo Nan, head of investor relations at the bank.American International Group, the biggest insurer in the world, may lose up to $2.3 billion from securities backed by subprime mortgages, analysts said.In a ""worst-case scenario,"" AIG could lose $2.3 billion from its investments in subprime mortgage bonds as well as loans given to borrowers with poor or limited credit, A.G. Edwards analysts in St. Louis, Missouri, said in a report Wednesday.The Asian credit market is showing ""limited signs of panic"" to the fallout from the U.S. mortgage meltdown, said Patrick Lynch, head of the Asia corporate credit group at Morgan Stanley.Optimism that economic growth in Asia will bolster corporate earnings has mitigated the impact on the region's debt market, Lynch said. ""We are not seeing full-blown panic now because there are still two-way flows, not just one way going down with no bid,"" he said."
31,"FRANKFURT —The president of the German central bank on Thursday offered reassurances about the soundness of the country's banks after losses in the U.S. subprime mortgage market hit a German lender.""Fears of a banking crisis in Germany lack any foundation,"" the Bundesbank president, Axel Weber, said. His statement followed a rescue of IKB Deutsche Industriebank by the state bank KfW - which owns 38 percent of IKB - and Germany's banking association.""The problems at IKB are of an institution-specific nature,"" Weber said. ""They have been absorbed effectively by the support of KfW.""German banks have joined together to provide €3.5 billion, or $4.8 billion, to cover IKB's potential losses from the subprime crisis in the United States.IKB said Thursday that it has access to enough funds for the next year.IKB, which specializes in lending to small and midsize companies, has become Europe's most high-profile casualty so far of the crisis. Its troubles had sparked investor fears that other German banks might be affected.Among those helping to bail out IKB are Germany's regional, government-owned banks, said Karl-Heinz Boos, managing director of the Association of German Public Sector Banks.The banks, owned by Germany's state and federal governments and known as Landesbanken, are involved along with private banks, he said.According to media reports, the private banks involved include Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank. Both declined to comment.KfW Bankengruppe, the government-owned development bank and part-owner of IKB, has said the financial obligations totaled €8.1 billion.IKB's problems stem from an apparent funding shortfall at one of its investments. That stems from exposure to U.S. subprime real estate loans, which were made to borrowers with weak or no credit histories.According to the filing, KfW assumed all ""rights and obligations"" to a fund that invested in subprime-related securities, Rhineland Funding Capital.On Monday, IKB issued a profit warning, saying it had ""felt the impact of the crisis in the U.S. subprime mortgage market."" It also said its chief executive, Stefan Ortseifen had resigned. Ortseifen was succeeded by a KfW board member, Günther Bräunig.Also, German cooperative banks confirmed Thursday that they were part of the rescue operation. Three pillars of the German banking system are private banks, government-owned banks and cooperative banks.The involvement of government-owned banks in the IKB rescue operation has raised questions as to whether it constitutes a state subsidy, which could be illegal under European Union rules. A spokesman at the European Commission has said a decision will be made ""in due course"" once it receives information about the support measures from the German authorities.A German Finance Ministry spokesman said that because private companies were taking part in the aid, the act of subsidizing IKB should not come into conflict with EU regulations."

33,"Two major European banks, the Credit Suisse Group and Société Générale of France, reported strong second-quarter results yesterday with help from growth in their investment banking units.Both Société Générale and Credit Suisse noted their low exposure to the credit crisis linked to subprime mortgage risks in the United States, which has hit some European banks in recent months.The low exposure has proved a boon for Credit Suisse, allowing it to remain unscathed compared with banks such as UBS that do more business in the United States, said Cubillas Ding, an analyst at Celent, a financial research and consulting firm.Mr. Ding also said Credit Suisse had done well to continue with its cost-cutting program.Credit Suisse, which is based in Zurich, said net profit for the quarter ended June 30 rose 48 percent, to 3.2 billion Swiss francs ($2.65 billion), exceeding analysts’ expectations. Pretax income from its investment banking unit rose 94 percent, to 2.5 billion francs ($2.07 billion) and revenue was up 45 percent, to 11.7 billion francs ($9.71 billion).Société Générale, based in Paris, said its second-quarter earnings rose 33 percent, to 1.74 billion euros ($2.38 billion), helped by the 235 million euros ($321.1 million) sale of its stake in Euronext.The results exceeded analysts’ expectations.Investors welcomed the results, with Credit Suisse shares rising 1.75 percent, to 81.40 francs ($67.61) in Zurich. Société Générale rose 4.3 percent, to 129.90 euros ($177.97) in Paris.The French bank said second-quarter revenue rose 16 percent to 6.62 billion euros ($9.06 billion). Corporate and investment bank activities, Société Générale’s biggest earner, posted a 22 percent increase in second-quarter profit to 721 million euros ($987.6 million), led by equity derivatives and advisory services.Profit at its international retail segment rose 55.6 percent, to 168 million euros ($230 million)."
34,"The problem faced by American Home Mortgage Investment in the weeks before it collapsed was aptly summarized 134 years ago by Walter Bagehot, the English journalist:“Every banker,” he wrote in “Lombard Street,” his exploration of the banking world, “knows that if he has to prove that he is worthy of credit, however good may be his arguments, in fact his credit is gone.”So as American Home — a big mortgage lender structured as a real estate investment trust — faced a crisis, it kept quiet and tried to act as if all was normal.For three weeks, it struggled to meet margin calls on its highly leveraged portfolio of mortgages and mortgage securities, but said nothing to its public shareholders. To admit that it was having such problems would only have encouraged other creditors to demand their money.But hanging over it was the fact that it had promised to pay $30 million in dividends to common stock holders last Friday, and an additional $3 million in preferred dividends this past Tuesday. Not big numbers for a company with $20 billion in assets on its books, perhaps, but more than American Home could raise.So after 10 p.m. on Friday, it announced that it was delaying payment of the dividends “in order to preserve liquidity.”Of course, as Bagehot knew, such a delay assured that any liquidity it might have possessed would vanish.It was not until Tuesday afternoon that American Home Mortgage started to come clean. It was, it said, “currently experiencing a hindering of access to its traditional credit facilities.” That meant no one wanted to lend it money. It had “substantial unpaid margin calls.” It would not make at least $750 million in mortgage loans that it had promised.Yesterday, the company gave up and said it would make no more loans. “Our business is no longer viable,” said Michael Strauss, the chief executive. The common shares are likely to be worthless.American Home had ranked No. 13 in mortgage lending in America, well behind the No. 1 lender, Countrywide Financial, which decided last night that it needed to prove its credit was sound. Countrywide said in a news release that it has “significant short-term funding liquidity cushions.”Bagehot would not have been happy to hear Countrywide thought that was necessary.At American Home, there had been clues that all was not well.The company managed to report a first-quarter profit only by changing accounting policies in a way that allowed it to report profits on sales of mortgages before it had, in fact, managed to sell them.It had disclosed that it was borrowing money with shorter maturities than previously — a possible indication that lenders were getting a little nervous — and that it had fully drawn down a line of credit intended to finance working capital needs.Some of its mortgages were reeling because customers with good credit scores — not subprime borrowers — were allowed to buy homes with little or no money down, no proof of income and payment terms that did not even require them to pay the full amount of interest being accrued. In April, Mr. Strauss promised that no more such loans would be made.But, says Zach Gast of the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, the company did not disclose how much of its reported profits came from such phantom interest payments, even though it was supposed to do so if the amounts involved were significant.One lesson that should be learned is the hazard of new accounting rules — like the one American Home Mortgage used to report a quarterly profit — that allow companies to report earnings when the market values of their assets rise.Such market values are what investors need to know, but the rules provide an invitation for companies to make very generous estimates, particularly if the company is trying to cover up what it hopes will be a temporary problem.Some analysts figured out that things were going wrong. Donald Fandetti of Citigroup put a sell on the stock on April 9, after it disclosed the first-quarter numbers. That did not, however, stop Citi from acting as the sole underwriter for the company’s April 30 offering of four million shares, at a price of $23.10 each.In connection with that offering, the company made one disclosure that turned out to be prescient:The company’s borrowings “are collateralized by the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets,” it said. “If the value of the assets falls, we could face margin calls that we are unable to meet, in which case our assets would be liquidated on unfavorable terms. In such event, we would likely experience large losses of our equity and sharply reduced income or losses from our portfolio assets.”Having given the warning, however, the company was very slow to let on that the threat had come true. During the three weeks that it was facing margin calls quietly, 56 million shares traded, and the stock fell from $17.58 to $10.47.That is more than the 54 million shares outstanding, and an indication that American Home’s travails were not a secret to all.It was those who trusted the company and its management who were left holding the bag."
35,"Charles O. Prince III cannot catch a break.Three weeks ago, Mr. Prince, the chief executive of Citigroup, brushed aside concerns that the era of easy money for buyout deals was about to end, optimistic that the banking giant was “still dancing.”But as credit problems that started in subprime mortgages have pushed into the broader market, many on Wall Street think the music has stopped. Mr. Prince says the recent market pullback “feels sharp,” but he is insistent that Citigroup will keep moving.“We see a lot of people on the Street who are scared,” Mr. Prince, 57, said during an interview Wednesday in his wood-paneled office at Citigroup’s Park Avenue headquarters. “We are not scared. We are not panicked. We are not rattled. Our team has been through this before.”Timing has never been Mr. Prince’s forte. In mid-July, Citigroup posted its second consecutive quarter of strong results, with an 18 percent increase in income. With signs that a turnaround was working, the company’s stock appeared poised for a move.Then the credit markets collapsed, and Citigroup’s shares tumbled along with most financial stocks.“The irony is that this has been by far the best two quarters for Chuck Prince since he was named chief executive” in October 2003, said Michael Mayo, a banking analyst for Deutsche Bank. “But the ultimate measure of the C.E.O.’s performance is its stock price, and on that point, Citigroup has woefully underperformed.”Yesterday, Citigroup’s shares closed at $47.24, up 2 percent. That is 24 cents higher than when Mr. Prince took over for Sanford I. Weill. Over the same four-year period, Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase shares have soared more than 23 percent.Investors, consequently, have not warmed to Mr. Prince’s plans for growth. While calls for him to step down have subsided, many on Wall Street are still unconvinced that the bank is in the right hands. Mr. Prince, though disappointed with the share price, pointed to the early signs of progress and said he was upbeat about the company’s direction.“I think our performance is going to last much longer than the market turbulence does,” he said.Since taking the helm four years ago, Mr. Prince has confronted one crisis after another. He went from resolving regulatory problems in Europe and Japan to bowing to American regulators in order to lift an ban on big acquisitions. He promised heavy investment in the company’s ailing businesses, only to watch expenses spiral out of control. He appointed a cost-control czar to shore up his management team, only to reshuffle the group a month later after the ouster of Todd S. Thomson, in part for flying Maria Bartiromo, the CNBC anchor, on Citigroup’s corporate jet.Only recently, Mr. Prince has started to find his groove. His new finance chief, Gary L. Crittenden, has been well received both inside and outside the company and credited with instilling financial discipline.A corporate overhaul started in April has helped reverse the trend of expenses outpacing revenue. And while Citigroup’s North American consumer division is still limping along, its investment banking and overseas operations have been on a tear. International revenue surged 12 percent in the second quarter.“He’s got some small signs of progress, but this is not an easy task to turn the ship around,” an analyst at Banc of America Securities, John McDonald, said.“The validation will come over the next couple of quarters,” Mr. McDonald added. “The last quarters, while outstanding, were reliant on a robust capital market environment that may not exist anymore.”In the interview Wednesday, Mr. Prince said he was forging ahead with plans to create a leaner company and accelerate growth.Analysts say that will be difficult, given the size and complexity of Citigroup’s businesses and years of underinvestment in its technology. The choppiness of the debt and equity markets only complicates the task.Mr. Prince’s strategy calls for streamlining operations by cutting layers of management and upgrading computer systems. He wants to strengthen the connections between the bank’s businesses while bolstering its operations in faster-growing markets overseas.But he offered a few adjustments to his plan, some of which Citigroup’s directors discussed at the annual retreat in mid-July. Instead of examining one or two businesses, Citigroup’s directors took a comprehensive look at the company’s overall direction for the next five years.Internationally, Mr. Prince said the company was rethinking its investment strategy. While Citigroup has no plans to pull out of the 100 or so countries where it operates, he said the company will begin to concentrate on a smaller number of countries where it can build market share.With more than 60 percent of its revenue expected to come from international operations, Mr. Prince expressed a desire for more people from overseas to fill upper management positions and serve on the board. Only four of 15 Citigroup directors were born or live overseas.Across Citigroup, Mr. Prince said, executives were pruning the portfolios of its core businesses in order to improve overall returns. There are no plans to sell or spin them off.“This is about being smarter, getting things on and off the balance sheet faster,” he said, “and the velocity of assets — as opposed to changing the configuration.”Institutionalizing cost-cutting efforts is another focus. The company recently hired its first chief restructuring officer, who will identify more areas for savings.“Every year, when we do our budget, we want to build into the budget 3 to 5 percent cost reductions,” Mr. Prince said. “We don’t want to wait for a big bang and take a big charge.”That could help quiet investors.“I think investors want better results,” Mr. McDonald, the analyst, said. “They want to see a clearer connection between the strategy and the financial results. Having two good quarters under the belt is a good start, but I still sense people expect improvement in the cost-savings area.”More immediately, Mr. Prince faces the challenge of navigating the volatile markets. Investors have grown increasingly concerned that the problems in the subprime mortgage market could spread elsewhere in the economy.More attuned to risks, they turned their backs on the leveraged buyout loans that fueled the recent buyout boom. That could force the banks to sell the loans at a discounted price, lowering revenue, or carry them on their balance sheets and swallow potentially large write-downs. Citigroup has one of the biggest loan books on Wall Street.Only a few weeks ago, Mr. Prince played down the prospect of a disruption to the credit markets when he told The Financial Times that the flood of liquidity meant that Citigroup was “still dancing” to the music of the buyout boom.This week, however, Mr. Prince noted that investors who once snapped up leveraged loans with easy financing terms were pretty much on the sidelines as the “market shakes itself out and probably will for a period of time.”But he pointed out that despite the disruption in the credit markets, the underlying businesses that were borrowing the money were doing fine.And he expressed confidence in his capital markets managers, who have worked together through seven or eight credit cycles. “We have had a period of great liquidity excess,” Mr. Prince said. “What we are seeing now is a pullback into a range of more normal kinds of credit experiences.“Deals are happening. Financing is occurring,” he added. “But it is occurring not in the lax kind of way or excess kind of way but in ways that have been more traditional.”"
36,"FRANKFURT —Prosecutors in Düsseldorf and government regulators in Berlin are looking into how a German bank became overexposed in the U.S. subprime mortgage lending crisis, but stopped short Friday of announcing a formal investigation.Smaller-scale shock waves continued to reverberate, however, even as financial heavyweights like Allianz sought to reassure their investors they would not be hit.Union Investment Asset Management Holding, one of Germany's top three mutual fund managers, said it had halted redemptions from a fund holding subprime mortgages after clients withdrew about 10 percent of the assets in the past month.Investors redeemed €100 million, or $136 million, from the €950 million ABS-Invest Fund, Markus Temme, a spokesman, said. The fund, sold to institutional investors across Europe, has about 6 percent of its assets in securities related to subprime mortgage loans, Temme said. Union Investment, which is owned by Germany's cooperative banks, has taken the steps ""because of illiquidity in the market,"" he said.Meanwhile, the German commercial property financier Hypo Real Estate struggled to calm jittery investors by insisting it would be unaffected by the U.S. subprime fallout.Its shares skidded more than 6 percent while Commerzbank - which owns a property financier - saw its stock fall as much.Investor confidence was further dented as it emerged that French insurer AXA had also temporarily closed two subprime funds after sudden losses.Even the German Pharmacist & Doctor's Bank issued an unexpected statement that it had €115 million of subprime exposure - equal to one year's profit.""A lot of the subprime debt lies with European managers,"" said Iain Beattie, a consultant at Watson Wyatt Worldwide in London who advises pension funds. ""There could be more news to drip out on this.""Peter Lichtenberg, a prosecutor in Düsseldorf, said that there was no official investigation under way of IKB Deutsche Industriebank, which has become Europe's highest-profile casualty so far of the U.S. subprime crisis.But, he said, prosecutors, along with BaFin, Germany's financial regulator, and IKB itself were collecting information about events leading up to the bank's inability to cover its funding needs, ""to see what we will do next.""IKB shares, which plunged by more than 48 percent this week, and closed Friday in Frankfurt at €12.46, down 34 cents.Earlier in the week, it emerged that banks backing an IKB rescue expected it to lose up to a fifth of its €17.5 billion subprime investment.The revelation of the scale of the problem, which followed IKB's assurances that it would barely be affected by property difficulties in the United States, prompted the head of the German central bank to call repeatedly for calm in the market.A group representing small investors in Germany also said it was considering suing IKB over the shambles that has wiped out roughly half of IKB's market worth over the past week.Deutsche Bank, worried about IKB's subprime exposure, cut a credit line to the bank last week, a move which sparked the IKB crisis and spurred Bafin into action. German banks also got together to provide €3.5 billion to cover the lender's potential losses.Just 10 days before a shock profit warning on Monday, the bank had said it would be almost entirely unaffected by the problems in the property market. Bafin brokered a deal with the German government that state bank KfW would guarantee €8 billion of obligations for IKB stemming from an investment fund IKB managed. This was designed to prevent the bank being forced into a fire sale of its investments.Subsequently KfW put up the lion's share of the €3.5 billion rescue fund set up to cover IKB's likely losses when IKB does sell its investments."
37,"COOLUM, Australia —The U.S. deputy secretary of the Treasury, Robert Kimmitt, said Friday that the troubles roiling the debt market were temporary and a much-needed correction to the markets, and were unlikely to cause problems for the broader U.S. economy.There are widespread worries that problems caused by defaults in the U.S. subprime mortgage market will continue to spread to other debt markets. But Kimmitt, speaking in an interview, said that although it would take some time for the housing market to recover, the problem had been contained and was not expected to infect other areas of the economy.""It is proceeding in an orderly fashion and it appears to be contained largely because it is happening within a healthy, diverse economy within a very strong world economy,"" he said on the sidelines of a meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation finance ministers.""The consumer spending figures that came out most recently were a little bit softer than consumer spending had been, but interestingly, a day or two later consumer sentiment figures came out and they were the highest for six years, so right now that very important part of our economy does not look to have been directly affected by this.""His comments were echoed by Mark Johnson, the head of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum Business Advisory Council, and a founder of Macquarie Bank of Australia.""I think there's a genuine feeling that the world's awash with liquidity, and that that's not going away; that corporate balance sheets are really sound and that banking systems worldwide are in good shape,"" he said.Both men said the markets had failed to adequately assess the risk factor in loans.""To some degree, the broader effect may be the message this has sent about the need for proper attention to be paid to risk, but what we are seeing is a market adjustment that seems to be proceeding as markets should adjust,"" Kimmitt said.But Kimmitt drew a brusque response from his Chinese counterpart when he aired Washington's long-standing grievances at the slowness of exchange-rate reform.Echoing the comments of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, who visited Beijing this week, Kimmitt urged China to revalue its currency. Washington believes that Beijing is keeping the exchange rate artificially low in a bid to boost China's exports and limit imports.""We think that it is in China's interest first and foremost, the regional economy and the world economy for China to move quicker,"" he said.China's finance minister, Jin Renqing, said room for maneuver was limited and that China would not be pushed on the issue.""We will continue with our currency reform, not because of demand from other countries but because of our own economic needs and developments,"" Jin said.The APEC ministerial meeting, which finished Friday in the beachside resort of Coolum in Queensland State, represented a significant shift in priorities, reflecting a change in the global power balance.Most recent multilateral meetings have been dominated by U.S. security concerns, but this meeting concentrated on matters closer to Asia's heart: energy security, access to capital, and managing financial risk.Kimmitt says there is a new self-confidence in Asia.""I think the positions they are putting forward now are stronger because of the improved economic performance both in individual economies and in the region more broadly,"" he said.That new self-confidence, coupled with China's rise, has led to a significant dilution of Washington's influence in the region, prompting some analysts to predict a confrontation. Kimmitt thinks the analysis is flawed.""I have never been a believer in a zero-sum game theory,"" he said, comparing Asia's new identity to that of Europe as the European Union was coming together 20 years ago."
38,"Volatility was the catchphrase for the stock market last week. Stocks veered up and down sharply, and a swoon in the last two hours of trading on Friday plunged the market into negative territory for the week.Abrupt late-day movements in the major stock indexes were commonplace. On Friday afternoon, the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 280 points — a decline whose immediate cause appeared to be a gloomy forecast of turmoil in the bond markets made by a Bear Stearns executive during a conference call. But worries about the strength of the economy, the housing slump and the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis certainly weighed on the markets.Still, the stock market posted strong gains on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. Sharp declines on Tuesday and on Friday offset those gains, however.For the week, the Dow fell 83.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to close at 13,181.91. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 25.89 points, or 1.8 percent, to close at 1,433.06. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 50.99 points, or 2 percent, to close at 2,511.25.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note fell to 4.68 percent from 4.76 percent the previous week."
39,"The crisis in the credit markets finally reached the executive suite of Wall Street firms last week, and the victim was an unexpected one: Warren J. Spector, a co-president at Bear Stearns who some had thought could become the firm’s next chief executive.Wednesday, the firm’s chief executive, James E. Cayne, called Mr. Spector into his spacious office on the sixth floor of the Bear Stearns building on Madison Avenue. Sitting behind his half-moon desk surrounded by computer terminals, Mr. Cayne told Mr. Spector that he wanted his resignation.“I have to do this,” he said, according to people who were briefed on the conversation. “I can’t work with you anymore.”The news is said to have blindsided Mr. Spector, 49, who had spent his entire 24-year career at Bear and who at one point had become the largest individual shareholder after Mr. Cayne, who is 73.Since two of its hedge funds collapsed in June, Bear Stearns and Mr. Cayne have become the public face of the plunging debt markets — a point that was underscored on Friday when Standard & Poor’s changed its outlook for the firm to negative from stable.In the months since the crisis at Bear became public, the firm’s stock is down 33 percent, to $108 a share, raising anew questions about the firm’s long-term viability as an independent company.A board meeting was held Sunday, where his departure became official. Alan D. Schwartz, Mr. Spector’s longtime co-president, who oversee investment banking, will take full ownership of the title — making him the probable heir to Mr. Cayne.The abrupt tightening of the credit markets recently has hit Bear Stearns particularly hard. In many ways it is a crisis that Bear, with its long expertise in bonds, structured products and in particular mortgage-backed securities, should have seen coming.Yet Bear, like many other firms on Wall Street, jumped into the market for bonds that backed subprime, or high risk, mortgages, offering a slew of racy fund products, one of which hit the market last August, just before the markets began to recoil from subprime assets. Mr. Spector, who was responsible for these areas, took the blame.While other firms might have had as much or even more exposure, Bear had the misfortune of having two funds implode, prompting investors in the funds and the firm’s stock, to question its competence in this area.Mr. Spector’s areas of responsibility, which included trading, equities, fixed income, energy and asset management, now fall under Mr. Schwartz. Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., the chief financial officer, was named chief operating officer. Jeffrey Mayer, co-head of fixed income, was named to the executive committee.Mr. Schwartz’s fast ascension also raises the possibility that he might succeed Mr. Cayne sooner rather than later. While Mr. Cayne’s control over the firm and the board remains vise-like, he has said publicly that the recent damage to the firm’s reputation has been a “body blow.”According to people inside the firm, Mr. Spector’s position became untenable shortly after the troubles of its two hedge funds became public in June. Not only did the asset management business report to him but he also had direct responsibility over the risk controls that were in place there.In recent weeks, Mr. Spector had been working long days to control the bleeding that started with the collapse of the two hedge funds, a crisis that Mr. Cayne has told people in the firm that ranks as one of the worst in the firm’s 84-year history.Mr. Spector is a cool, aloof man who has the casual confidence of one who achieved significant professional success at a young age — he became a Bear director at age 32.He owned about 75,000, or 0.064 percent, of the outstanding shares in Bear compared with Mr. Cayne’s 5.6 million, or 5.6 percent.But since the crisis broke in June, he had been pushing to find answers, accepting responsibility internally and telling people that Bear never should have introduced such a highly leveraged fund that carried so much risk, one of which would go on to lose all investor assets.But that was not enough. According to people briefed on the events, Mr. Cayne, a tournament-level bridge player who is famous for keeping people in the dark about his intentions, felt that the move was critical to restoring trust in Bear. Few were aware of his decision, these people say, although Mr. Cayne did take the counsel of Vincent Tese, the lead director at Bear and an intimate of Mr. Cayne whose involvement in the firm’s inner workings is such that he maintains an office a few doors down from Mr. Cayne.The news also came as a surprise to Mr. Schwartz, the co-president, who tried to persuade Mr. Cayne to delay any action until an internal report had been completed, these people said. But in the end, Mr. Schwartz along with other top Bear executives supported Mr. Cayne’s decision unanimously. Neither Mr. Cayne, Mr. Spector nor Mr. Schwartz would comment for this article.For Mr. Spector, his abrupt firing marks an inglorious end to a career that from the beginning seemed destined to end with the top job at Bear Stearns.Indeed, with Mr. Spector’s own talent for bridge — he achieved the rank of life master at age 16 in 1974 — and his expertise in all varieties of bonds, it was widely assumed that Mr. Cayne would pass on the reins to Mr. Spector. (The two men’s devotion to bridge is highlighted by the fact that they both attended the North American bridge championship in Nashville in late July, at a time of increasing turmoil in the credit markets.)But while bridge might have functioned as a bonding agent between Mr. Cayne and his predecessor, Alan C. Greenberg, it could not do the same for Mr. Spector — especially in the wake of the hedge fund meltdown at the firm’s asset management division.Indeed, according to several senior Bear executives, none of whom would speak for attribution because they were not authorized to make public statements about matters at the firm, Mr. Spector’s internal position at Bear had been weakening in recent years as his relationship with Mr. Cayne cooled, despite the fact that he was responsible for a majority of the firm’s profit.A smooth and at times imperious man with a wide-ranging intellect, Mr. Spector is an aggressive Democratic fund-raiser and active patron of the arts. With his wife Margaret Whitton, a stage and screen actress who appeared in the movie “9 1/2 Weeks,” he was an active supporter and chairman of the Public Theater, which puts on the Shakespeare in the Park series in New York.Despite his well-polished public profile and operational sway, he was not as tight with Mr. Cayne as other executives like Mr. Schwartz and Mr. Molinaro.There were occasional signs of this estrangement over the years. In 2004, Mr. Cayne, a committed Republican, publicly upbraided Mr. Spector for making it seem that his own support for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee in the 2004 presidential election, constituted an endorsement from Bear Stearns itself. And during a recent interview with Mr. Cayne at his Bear Stearns office, Mr. Spector did not show up despite being asked to do so by Mr. Cayne, prompting Mr. Cayne to dryly take note of his absence.On another recent occasion, a reporter shared an elevator with the two men at Bear Stearns headquarters, and they did not say a word to each other for the entire ride, each staring in the opposite direction.In part this was a function of their sharply different personalities. Mr. Cayne is a raw, cigar-chomping man who embraces the scrappy, streetfighting ethos of the firm. Mr. Spector, who wears his thick head of hair longer than that of the standard banker, has more of suave, relaxed affect.And in the end it might have been this sense that he was entitled to succeed Mr. Cayne, given his role in building Bear’s thriving bond business, that proved to be his undoing. While Mr. Cayne is revered, if not at times feared, within the firm, Mr. Spector’s distant manner and his inclination to act in the style of a chief executive would grate on top executives there.In the summer, he often skipped out of town on Thursdays to his weekend home in Martha’s Vineyard — where he remained hunkered down over the weekend — and he only infrequently became immersed in the gritty operational details of the units that reported to him.Still, it is also true that his unflappable mien and his deep technical awareness of Bear’s complicated businesses may have been missed on Friday when he was not present on a conference call to investors to comment on the S.& P. outlook change. Mr. Spector rarely presided over conference calls, but if there was a moment to start, this would have been it. Instead of sticking to the positive — that Bear still had an A-plus/A-1 credit rating with ample liquidity — Mr. Molinaro, the finance chief, went further, calling the crisis the worst he had seen in 22 years and comparing it with the popping of the Internet bubble in 2000 and the hedge fund implosion at Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.As any good trader would say, don’t focus on the negative when you don’t have to. The already rattled markets took note and sold off further."
40,"THE seized-up United States mortgage market claimed more victims both here and abroad last week. The American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation, once a big lender, closed its doors, laying off more than 6,000 workers. In Germany, IKB Deutsche Industriebank received a $4.8 billion bailout from a government-owned group that said it would cover potential subprime losses at the bank.In a report last week, Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners, an independent research firm in New York, characterized the state of the mortgage market this way: “Investors finally realized that there is such a thing as a bad mortgage loan. As a matter of fact, there is such a thing as a whole bunch of bad mortgage loans.”As a result, Mr. Peabody noted, investors are no longer interested in most of the risky loans that mortgage bankers have been creating lately. Bankers can sell only the highest-grade pieces of those wonderful securities pools that were so popular among investors until about five minutes ago.That gives two choices — neither one felicitous — to the bankers who originated the low-grade loans. They can either sell them at a loss, reflecting the market’s view of such debt, or hold them on their own balance sheets and watch them decline in value.It is never pretty, watching a mania come undone. Unless you are one of the folks who never bought into the madness in the first place.Michael A. J. Farrell, chief executive of Annaly Capital Management, a high-grade mortgage real estate investment trust, is one such man. And with a perspective on the residential mortgage and credit markets extending back to the 1970s, he is an excellent person to consult on what is likely to happen next.Annaly is an investment management company that oversees a portfolio of strictly high-grade assets. The company invests solely in mortgages backed by government-sponsored entities like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Investors understand that it has little exposure to the current credit crunch and have bid up its shares almost 8 percent this year. The shares also pay a generous dividend of 6.4 percent at current prices.For his conservative approach, Mr. Farrell confirms that for about two years beginning in 2003, he took plenty of abuse from more aggressive counterparts in the industry and from potential investors who urged him to buy lower-quality assets for their greater returns. Some of those ridiculing Mr. Farrell were the same people who jeered at investors who did not get the new paradigm, espoused in 1999, that any-Internet-company-is-a-good-Internet-company.“I definitely took heat not only in my professional life but in my personal life,” Mr. Farrell said. “I had people stop me on the street while I was walking my dog saying, ‘Where is your dividend going?’ ”During the crazy years, Mr. Farrell and his team decided against increasing the size of Annaly’s balance sheet. Investors willing to throw money into anything mortgage scoffed when the company turned them down. “We decided to withdraw from the market until the end of 2005, when we thought investment risk was being recognized by the market,” he said.Mortgage real estate investment trusts came public like weeds during the boom, of course. But the strategies they use can vary widely. Some originate mortgages — New Century did, for example — and others buy mortgage loans in the secondary market, whether risky or not.Most mortgage REITs do a bit of everything, explained Jeremy Diamond, a managing director at Annaly. As a result, investors in these companies must rely on their managers to put the right emphasis on credit risk and interest rate risk at different periods in a business cycle.But because Annaly shuns credit risk, its investors are trusting its managers to bet appropriately on interest rate risk only. In this they are also conservative, holding assets with a duration of six months to two years. They also have one-third of their portfolio in fixed-rate assets, with the rest in adjustable- and floating-rate assets; this allows the portfolio to work well whether rates decline or rise.“There is no official Annaly interest rate forecast,” Mr. Diamond said. “We manage the portfolio with no significant directional bias because we could be wrong.”Annaly’s biggest challenge comes when rates plunge, as they did in 2004, pushing mortgage holders to refinance. But it has reduced its exposure to refinancing risk in recent months by raising about $2.5 billion in capital and reducing the premium-priced mortgages in its portfolio. While the company paid an average of $102.50 per $100 worth of bonds in its portfolio in 2003, its average is now $100.50.When the mortgage market started to regain some of its sense in 2006, Annaly began raising money from investors. It made two stock offerings in 2006 and two more this year. Each time, the deals carried a higher price tag, reflecting investors’ appreciation of Annaly’s conservative business model. Even those who bought into the company’s most recent offering last month — at $14 a share — are ahead. Annaly’s shares closed Friday at $14.98.Mr. Farrell and other Annaly executives also align themselves with their investors by not taking performance fees as most REITs do. Instead, the executives’ compensation, just 0.12 percent of assets under management, comes out of the company’s revenues.So what does Mr. Farrell, who has been through at least three mortgage market seizures in his career, see on the horizon for the credit markets? More of the same turmoil, alas.“I look at this sort of like 1990 and 1991,” he said, referring to the savings-and-loan crisis. “Against that background you had a $7 trillion economy that gave birth to the $300 billion Resolution Trust Corp. Now we have an $11 trillion economy and we’ve already seen $2 trillion of market capitalization going away” before many loans in the pools have actually defaulted, he said.WHAT about the people who argue that the impact of the mortgage mess will be muted because risks have been spread well beyond the banks and into many parts of the financial world? Mr. Farrell takes the opposite view. Spreading the risk beyond the banking system will make the task of fixing the mess much harder.“Even if the Fed eases, it is probably not going to help the housing market,” he said. “This repair cycle is going to take a lot longer because it is not concentrated in the banking system like it was in the 1990s. Back then, they could repair the banking system by dropping interest rates. Now they can’t bail out rich hedge fund guys in Greenwich.”"
41,"FOR an organization renowned for telegraphing its intentions, the Federal Reserve has left a lot of investors scratching their heads. Some take recent remarks by its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, as a sign that the next eventual move in interest rates will be up, while others are just as convinced that a cut is in store.But for the moment, at least, Wall Street is expecting the Fed to take no action. Instead, when policy makers meet on Tuesday, traders will be scouring the statement accompanying the Fed’s announcement for fresh clues to the central bank’s views on the economy and the direction of rates. Few will be forthcoming, one investment adviser predicts, so opinion is unlikely to solidify one way or the other.“There is probably less consensus at present than there was a couple of Fed meetings ago” about the rate outlook, said Fritz Meyer, senior investment officer at AIM Investments.He expects the statement’s wording to conform to Mr. Bernanke’s recent testimony to Congress, highlighting the economy’s strength.“Ben Bernanke made clear that tightening on credit conditions had not been enough to slow the economy any more than the Fed is projecting,” Mr. Meyer said. The Fed and many private economists anticipate a dip in growth over the next two or three quarters as the housing market slowdown plays out, followed by a resurgence next year.A confirmation of those sentiments is unlikely to clarify the outlook for rates, but the mood of investors is so grim after the declines of the last two weeks that merely upholding the status quo may provoke a relief rally, he said. But the high anxiety in the market means that any deviation in the message may not be taken well.“The market will want to see something similar,” Mr. Meyer said. If Mr. Bernanke, through the Fed statement, “reiterates what he said to Congress, that he isn’t too concerned about the impact of subprime mortgages, it could be the catalyst for a slight lift to stocks.”By contrast, if the statement were to express concern about the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis on the overall economy, ""it could be a problem for stocks,"" he said.Mr. Meyer expects the Fed to convey a benign point of view in its statement on Tuesday and in other pronouncements in the near future. Amid such a backdrop, stocks “could be a nice bit higher by the end of the year than they are today,” he said.As for whether the central bank will raise or lower rates, he is sticking with “neither.”“My own view is that the Fed is not going to do anything until we see lots more economic data toward the end of the year,” Mr. Meyer said. “I think they’re in static mode and not even close to deciding one way or the other.”DATA WATCHThe appetizer before the Fed serves up the main course on Tuesday is the report on second-quarter productivity. A Bloomberg News poll of economists forecasts an annual growth rate of 2 percent after 1 percent in the first quarter."
42,"The crisis in the credit markets finally reached the executive suite of Wall Street firms last week, and the victim was an unexpected one: Warren J. Spector, a co-president at Bear Stearns who some had thought could become the firm’s next chief executive.Wednesday, the firm’s chief executive, James E. Cayne, called Mr. Spector into his spacious office on the sixth floor of the Bear Stearns building on Madison Avenue. Sitting behind his half-moon desk surrounded by computer terminals, Mr. Cayne told Mr. Spector that he wanted his resignation.“I have to do this,” he said, according to people who were briefed on the conversation. “I can’t work with you anymore.”The news is said to have blindsided Mr. Spector, 49, who had spent his entire 24-year career at Bear and who at one point had become the largest individual shareholder after Mr. Cayne, who is 73.Since two of its hedge funds collapsed in June, Bear Stearns and Mr. Cayne have become the public face of the plunging debt markets — a point that was underscored on Friday when Standard & Poor’s changed its outlook for the firm to negative from stable.In the months since the crisis at Bear became public, the firm’s stock is down 33 percent, to $108 a share, raising anew questions about the firm’s long-term viability as an independent company.A board meeting was held yesterday, where his departure became official. Alan D. Schwartz, Mr. Spector’s longtime co-president, who oversees investment banking, will take full ownership of the title — making him the probable heir to Mr. Cayne.The abrupt tightening of the credit markets recently has hit Bear Stearns particularly hard. In many ways it is a crisis that Bear, with its long expertise in bonds, structured products and in particular mortgage-backed securities, should have seen coming.Yet Bear, like many other firms on Wall Street, jumped into the market for bonds that backed subprime, or high risk, mortgages, offering a slew of racy fund products, one of which hit the market last August, just before the markets began to recoil from subprime assets. Mr. Spector, who was responsible for these areas, took the blame.While other firms might have had as much or even more exposure, Bear had the misfortune of having two funds implode, prompting investors in the funds and the firm’s stock, to question its competence in this area.Mr. Spector’s areas of responsibility, which included trading, equities, fixed income, energy and asset management, now fall under Mr. Schwartz. Samuel L. Molinaro Jr., the chief financial officer, was named chief operating officer. Jeffrey Mayer, co-head of fixed income, was named to the executive committee.Mr. Schwartz’s fast ascension also raises the possibility that he might succeed Mr. Cayne sooner rather than later.

According to people briefed on the events, Cayne, who is famous for keeping people in the dark about his intentions, felt that the move was critical to restoring trust in Bear.The news came as a surprise to Schwartz, who tried to persuade Cayne to delay any action until an internal report had been completed, these people said. But in the end, Schwartz along with other top Bear executives supported Cayne's decision unanimously."
45,"The crisis in the credit markets finally reached the executive suite of Wall Street firms last week, and the victim was an unexpected one: Warren Spector, a co-president at Bear Stearns who some had thought could become the firm's next chief executive.Wednesday, the firm's chief executive, James Cayne, called Spector into his spacious office on the sixth floor of the Bear Stearns building on Madison Avenue. Sitting behind his half-moon desk surrounded by computer terminals, Cayne told Spector that he wanted his resignation.""I have to do this,"" he said, according to people who were briefed on the conversation. ""I can't work with you anymore.""The news is said to have blindsided Spector, 49, who had spent his entire 24-year career at Bear and who at one point had become the largest individual shareholder after Cayne, who is 73.Since two of its hedge funds collapsed in June, Bear Stearns and Cayne have become the public face of the plunging debt markets — a point that was underscored on Friday when Standard & Poor's changed its outlook for the firm to negative from stable.In the months since the crisis at Bear became public, the firm's stock is down 33 percent, to $108 a share, raising anew questions about the firm's long-term viability as an independent company.A board meeting was held Sunday, where his departure became official. Alan Schwartz, Spector's longtime co-president, who oversees investment banking, will take full ownership of the title — making him the probable heir to Cayne.The abrupt tightening of the credit markets recently has hit Bear Stearns particularly hard. In many ways it is a crisis that Bear, with its long expertise in bonds, structured products and in particular mortgage-backed securities, should have seen coming.Yet Bear, like many other firms on Wall Street, jumped into the market for bonds that backed subprime, or high risk, mortgages, offering a slew of racy fund products, one of which hit the market last August, just before the markets began to recoil from subprime assets. Spector, who was responsible for these areas, took the blame.While other firms might have had as much or even more exposure, Bear had the misfortune of having two funds implode, prompting investors in the funds and the firm's stock, to question its competence in this area.Spector's areas of responsibility, which included trading, equities, fixed income, energy and asset management, now fall under Schwartz. Samuel Molinaro Jr., the chief financial officer, was named chief operating officer. Jeffrey Mayer, co-head of fixed income, was named to the executive committee.Schwartz's fast ascension also raises the possibility that he might succeed Cayne sooner rather than later. While Cayne's control over the firm and the board remains vise-like, he has said publicly that the recent damage to the firm's reputation has been a ""body blow.""According to people inside the firm, Spector's position became untenable shortly after the troubles of its two hedge funds became public in June. Not only did the asset management business report to him but he also had direct responsibility over the risk controls that were in place there.In recent weeks, Spector had been working long days to control the bleeding that started with the collapse of the two hedge funds, a crisis that Cayne has told people in the firm that ranks as one of the worst in the firm's 84-year history.Spector is a cool, aloof man who has the casual confidence of one who achieved significant professional success at a young age — he became a Bear director at age 32.He owned about 75,000, or 0.064 percent, of the outstanding shares in Bear compared with Cayne's 5.6 million, or 5.6 percent.But since the crisis broke in June, he had been pushing to find answers, accepting responsibility internally and telling people that Bear never should have introduced such a highly leveraged fund that carried so much risk, one of which would go on to lose all investor assets.But that was not enough. According to people briefed on the events, Cayne, a tournament-level bridge player who is famous for keeping people in the dark about his intentions, felt that the move was critical to restoring trust in Bear. Few were aware of his decision, these people say, although Cayne did take the counsel of Vincent Tese, the lead director at Bear and an intimate of Cayne whose involvement in the firm's inner workings is such that he maintains an office a few doors down from Cayne.The news also came as a surprise to Schwartz, the co-president, who tried to persuade Cayne to delay any action until an internal report had been completed, these people said. But in the end, Schwartz along with other top Bear executives supported Cayne's decision unanimously. Neither Cayne, Spector nor Schwartz would comment for this article.For Spector, his abrupt firing marks an inglorious end to a career that from the beginning seemed destined to end with the top job at Bear Stearns.Indeed, with Spector's own talent for bridge — he achieved the rank of life master at age 16 in 1974 — and his expertise in all varieties of bonds, it was widely assumed that Cayne would pass on the reins to Spector. (The two men's devotion to bridge is highlighted by the fact that they both attended the North American bridge championship in Nashville in late July, at a time of increasing turmoil in the credit markets.)But while bridge might have functioned as a bonding agent between Cayne and his predecessor, Alan Greenberg, it could not do the same for Spector — especially in the wake of the hedge fund meltdown at the firm's asset management division.Indeed, according to several senior Bear executives, none of whom would speak for attribution because they were not authorized to make public statements about matters at the firm, Spector's internal position at Bear had been weakening in recent years as his relationship with Cayne cooled, despite the fact that he was responsible for a majority of the firm's profit.A smooth and at times imperious man with a wide-ranging intellect, Spector is an aggressive Democratic fund-raiser and active patron of the arts. With his wife Margaret Whitton, a stage and screen actress who appeared in the movie ""9 1/2 Weeks,"" he was an active supporter and chairman of the Public Theater, which puts on the Shakespeare in the Park series in New York.Despite his well-polished public profile and operational sway, he was not as tight with Cayne as other executives like Schwartz and Molinaro.There were occasional signs of this estrangement over the years. In 2004, Cayne, a committed Republican, publicly upbraided Spector for making it seem that his own support for Senator John Kerry, the Democratic nominee in the 2004 presidential election, constituted an endorsement from Bear Stearns itself. And during a recent interview with Cayne at his Bear Stearns office, Spector did not show up despite being asked to do so by Cayne, prompting Cayne to dryly take note of his absence.On another recent occasion, a reporter shared an elevator with the two men at Bear Stearns headquarters, and they did not say a word to each other for the entire ride, each staring in the opposite direction.In part this was a function of their sharply different personalities. Cayne is a raw, cigar-chomping man who embraces the scrappy, streetfighting ethos of the firm. Spector, who wears his thick head of hair longer than that of the standard banker, has more of suave, relaxed affect.And in the end it might have been this sense that he was entitled to succeed Cayne, given his role in building Bear's thriving bond business, that proved to be his undoing. While Cayne is revered, if not at times feared, within the firm, Spector's distant manner and his inclination to act in the style of a chief executive would grate on top executives there.In the summer, he often skipped out of town on Thursdays to his weekend home in Martha's Vineyard — where he remained hunkered down over the weekend — and he only infrequently became immersed in the gritty operational details of the units that reported to him.Still, it is also true that his unflappable mien and his deep technical awareness of Bear's complicated businesses may have been missed on Friday when he was not present on a conference call to investors to comment on the S.& P. outlook change. Spector rarely presided over conference calls, but if there was a moment to start, this would have been it. Instead of sticking to the positive — that Bear still had an A-plus/A-1 credit rating with ample liquidity — Molinaro, the finance chief, went further, calling the crisis the worst he had seen in 22 years and comparing it with the popping of the Internet bubble in 2000 and the hedge fund implosion at Long-Term Capital Management in 1998.As any good trader would say, don't focus on the negative when you don't have to. The already rattled markets took note and sold off further."

48,"FRANKFURT —The stricken U.S. subprime mortgage market showed fresh potential to suck in other investors when another German asset manager froze a fund on Tuesday, blaming a crisis triggered by the risky U.S. mortgages.WestLB Mellon temporarily closed a €235 million, or $323 million, asset-backed securities fund after seeing what it said was a sharp fall - 2.4 percent - in its value over the past week.The development is significant because it is the second fund manager to come unstuck even though it had not invested in subprime assets.The fund does, however, own securitized assets and so has an exposure to the credit markets, which have come under pressure in the wake of the subprime mortgage collapse.""The problem is that the subprime crisis has caused a liquidity crisis,"" Uwe Fuiten, a senior manager at WestLB Mellon, said. ""So we can't get a fair price for our investment.""The announcement comes just days after a German small-company lender, IKB, became Europe's highest-profile casualty of the subprime crisis, sending shock waves through the country's banking system.But while IKB was directly invested in subprime loans, that crisis has caused a domino reaction. Earlier this week, Frankfurt-Trust shut one of its ABS funds to stop panicking investors from withdrawing any more cash. Despite not having any subprime investments, it came under pressure after many worried investors demanded their money back.Default rates on mortgages to high-risk, or subprime, borrowers in the United States have been creeping up, leading to problems for lending banks as well as those sharing the risk.It has also spilled into credit markets, where banks and others buy and sell debt.Last week, German banks joined together to bankroll a €3.5 billion rescue to cover IKB's potential losses and stem what the financial regulator BaFin warned could snowball into the biggest banking crisis in Germany in more than 75 years."
49,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 8  President Bush, seeking to reassure Americans about the economy and combat Democratic criticism of his policies, said on Wednesday that recent financial market turbulence was not a cause for worry but a natural adjustment from the improvident lending of recent years.Speaking at the Treasury Department, with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. sitting across the table and reporters seated in a circle around them, Mr. Bush said that his economic advisers would be “paying close attention as the market begins to readjust its assessment of risk” in housing and other sectors.The president said he also discussed with Mr. Paulson and other cabinet members the possibility of tax cuts and reduced regulations aimed at overcoming what some see as a weakening of the competitiveness of American capital markets compared with those overseas. But he was cautious about saying what he might propose.“We worked through possible suggestions for Congress to think about,” Mr. Bush said. “It may be an issue that requires a lot of selling to get the conditions right for people to even take it seriously.”It was an unusual presentation for Mr. Bush, both politically and economically. Presidents are usually advised not to wade into discussions of markets at a time when they are so unpredictable and anxiety-inducing.Mr. Bush’s suggestion that the recent housing declines should be seen as a normal market correction from past excesses and that the government should avoid interfering with the process carries political risks at a time when some people are losing their homes, lending institutions are shaky and Democrats are demanding action.Indeed, immediately after the president’s comments, Democrats excoriated him for saying that the economy was in sound shape, and many called on the administration to encourage federal housing agencies to step in and make more money available, perhaps by buying up troubled mortgages to avoid foreclosures.For his part, Mr. Bush, in a verbal tour of the current economic scene, was eager both to calm the markets and knock down the Democratic calls for the administration to intervene, predicting that the turmoil in the housing sector would end with a “soft landing” and would not damage the larger economy.“I believe that markets ultimately look at the fundamentals of any economy,” Mr. Bush said. “And the fundamentals of our economy are strong. Inflation is down. Real wages are increasing. The job market is a strong job market. People are working. Small businesses are flourishing.”Mr. Bush, who has a master’s degree in business administration from Harvard, confidently used phrases like liquidity, risk assessment and market adjustment to describe complex economic conditions.Asked about collapsing housing markets, and the risk of them declining further, Mr. Bush said: “In a way it’s a necessary reaction to a flood of liquidity that came into the market in the past couple years.” That was financial jargon referring to the past several years of easy money, some of it from overseas, at low interest rates.Mr. Bush said that as a result of the deep pools of money available, “housing got really hot” and that a decline was inevitable. He added that “if the market functions normally” it will lead to a soft landing. “That’s kind of what it looks like so far,” he contended.Democrats are reacting to the current situation less philosophically. Several are calling for the two big government-sponsored buyers of mortgages from lenders, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to provide more money for housing by buying more loans and holding them.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York who is chairman of the housing subcommittee of the Senate Finance Committee, said that if these agencies did not act, it would lead to a collapse of the market for sound mortgages, not just the deeply troubled subprime loans that were sold to new homebuyers and people with less-than-sterling credit.“We need to allow Fannie and Freddie to put more credit into prime lending,” Mr. Schumer said. “This is favored by most Democrats and a good number of Republicans.”But Mr. Bush appeared to resist that idea, saying that the agencies needed to overhaul their own practices after experiencing accounting scandals before jumping into the current crisis. “Let’s get them reformed first,” he said.He said the housing crisis occurred in part because borrowers had not read the “fine print” on their mortgages. “There needs to be financial education measures in place,” he said.The president’s session with economic writers was unscheduled until Wednesday morning, when he was at the Treasury building for an annual meeting with his economic team. Their intent was to plan for issues like the budget, taxes and financial regulation coming up in the fall.After that meeting, Mr. Bush sounded several familiar themes, accusing Democrats of wanting to raise taxes and embark on wasteful spending. He said he would veto legislation to expand the children’s health insurance program, charging that it would raise taxes and “nationalize” the health sector, and reiterated his threat to veto other spending bills that went over his budget request.The statement appeared to signal the White House’s plan to go on the offensive in the fall to counter criticism and widespread economic anxiety by confronting Democrats on time-tested Republican themes like keeping taxes low and spending under control.“I understand there’s disquiet out there,” Mr. Bush said. “By the way, do you think they feel disquiet now? Go ahead and run up their taxes and see how they feel.”Mr. Bush also said he would oppose legislation aimed at punishing China for its economic practices, including its efforts to control the value of its currency to encourage cheaper exports. Expressing the need for the United States to lead the global economy, he called on Democrats to approve recently negotiated trade deals with Peru, Panama, Colombia and Korea.The Peru and Panama deals appeared to be on track for passage this year, but Democrats backed off in June. Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said in an interview that he now expected the Peru deal to proceed in September.Mr. Rangel was in Peru this week and said that Peruvian leaders had committed themselves to several steps to protect worker rights, reassuring him on that subject. “The Peruvians,” he said, “will be doing everything that has to be done for this to be passed.”Besides trade, Mr. Bush spoke at length about the failure of his immigration legislation this year, saying that he had predicted “there would be blowback” from growers who could not get immigrant workers to help pick produce. What was needed, he said, was a guest-worker program for these workers."
50,"Stocks on Wall Street today suffered their biggest one-day decline since February after the turmoil in the home-loan market caused renewed concerns about tightening credit worldwide.The decline began at the opening bell after a French bank, BNP Paribas, suspended operations of three of its funds in the wake of turmoil in the American market for home loans. The European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve injected cash into the financial system because of tightening credit markets.The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 13,270.68, down 387.18 points, or 2.8 percent. It was the biggest one-day decline since the Dow lost 416.02 points on Feb. 27, another day of a worldwide sell-off.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was off nearly 3 percent, at 1,453.10, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 2.2 percent, at 2,556.49.After the Dow dropped 200 points within minutes of the start of trading, the session was volatile, with stocks recovering much of their early losses, then declining anew.Prices of Treasury bonds jumped as investors fled to the safety of government paper.Asked at a news conference this morning whether he thought the turmoil in the subprime lending market could put a chill on credit in the broader economy, President Bush said he did not think that the federal government needs to step in to provide more money to the financial markets. “The fundamentals of our economy are strong,” he said.“Another factor one has got to look at is the amount of liquidity in the system,” he added. “In other words, is there enough liquidity to enable markets to be able to correct? And I am told there is enough liquidity in the system to enable markets to correct.”The latest upheaval on Wall Street came after a sell-off in Europe, which was prompted after BNP, the largest publicly traded bank in France, became the latest European lender to announce problems linked to the worsening credit market in the United States, where several large companies have already announced losses. Late last month, a group of German government-backed banks agreed to bail out a bank, IKB Deutsche Industriebank, whose investments in American mortgage securities have fallen significantly in value.With banks pulling back on lending over all, the European Central Bank lent more than $130 billion overnight at a rate of 4 percent after the overnight rates that banks charge to lend money to one another leaped. The Federal Reserve injected $24 billion to the United States banking system to keep its benchmark overnight lending rate at 5.25 percent, after it opened this morning at 5.5 percent.It is common for central banks to step in to stabilize the financial system when banks are either pumping too much or too little money into the markets. What was unusual about the move today was the size and speed with which the banks acted.“There is certainly a liquidity crisis in the financial system that the normal players themselves are having a little bit of difficulty working out,” said Jane Caron, chief economic strategist at Dwight Asset Management, a bond firm based in Vermont. “The Fed provided some assistance.”In the bond markets, Treasury prices were up and the yield on the 10-year note, which moves in the inverse direction of its price, fell to 4.805 percent, from 4.879 percent on Wednesday evening.The premium that investors demand to hold junk bonds and other riskier assets, which had gone down in the last couple days, increased somewhat today and trading was again light across the credit market.“It’s just indicative of a lack of confidence, of people really not know what is going on,” said Kingman Penniman, president of KDP Investment Advisors, a research firm that specializes in high-yield debt. “So they react quickly to good or bad news.”During the recent boom in credit, banks and brokerage firms lent large sums to hedge funds and other investors who drove down the premium on risky assets like bonds backed by subprime mortgages that are made to people with tarnished credit histories and those taking on excessive debt.Now as defaults on those loans are rising, banks and brokerages are demanding that fund managers come up with more collateral to back up margin loans or sell assets. Investors in these funds are also clamoring to redeem their shares in the funds.“It’s like popcorn in a kettle,” said James Melcher, president of Balestra Capital, a hedge fund based in New York. “First you have one or two pops, then it turns into a cacophony.”Most experts believe the nation’s mortgage problems will likely worsen in the coming months as hundreds of billions in adjustable-rate loans reset to higher rates in the next 12 to 18 months. At the end of March, nearly one in five subprime home loans were either past due or in foreclosure.At his news conference this morning, Mr. Bush said he did not support granting federal government funds to distressed homeowners who are on the verge of losing their homes, but he said the Federal Housing Administration should have flexibility to help borrowers refinance their home loans.He also said he felt “there needs to be more transparency in financial documents” so that borrowers “know what they’re signing up for.”The market appeared to react positively to remarks by Mr. Bush that the administration would not favor changing the way partners in private equity firms are taxed. In recent months, several prominent lawmakers have proposed subjecting the investment gains of fund managers — known as “carried interest” — to the ordinary income tax rate of up to 35 percent, rather than the capital gains rate of 15 percent.Noting that partnerships are a common structure among small businesses, Mr. Bush said he was satisfied with the current tax structure. “We are very, very hesitant about trying to target one aspect of limited partnerships,” he said, “for fear of it affecting small business growth.”Carried interest has come under criticism because it has allowed managers of private equity firms and hedge funds to pay very little in taxes on income they derive largely from managing their investors’ assets rather than putting their own capital at risk."
