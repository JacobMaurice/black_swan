0,"WASHINGTON —Could the housing market's problems in the United States spread to bonds held in mutual funds by millions of ordinary investors?Some experts - and hedge fund investors who have made big bets that the mortgage crisis will worsen - are saying that this is exactly what will happen. Some bond funds that invest in riskier short-term debt have already been hit by soaring default rates on bonds backed by subprime loans made to borrowers with weak credit.Critics accuse Standard & Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and Fitch Ratings, of routinely giving triple-A ratings, which is the safest possible rating, to far too many mortgage-backed bonds backed by subprime home loans.""The rating agencies just completely missed the boat in their methodology for rating these things,"" said Janet Tavakoli, president of Tavakoli Structured Finance, a Chicago consulting firm.About 80 percent of debt in bonds backed by subprime loans is rated triple-A, the same rating on virtually risk-free U.S. Treasury bonds, experts say.If that seems shocking, there are bonds backed by delinquent credit card accounts, one of the riskiest forms of debt, in which up to 40 percent of the accounts in the security are rated triple-A, said Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University, in Philadelphia.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Friday that it had started a review of what the three agencies' ratings mean and whether conflicts of interest were created if they gave advice to sellers of mortgage debt. Credit rating agencies say their role is to rate the creditworthiness of securities, not advise buyers or sellers of bonds.Congress has also pledged to hold hearings on the role the ratings agencies played in the subprime mortgage crisis that has led to Wall Street sell-offs and dampened consumer spending.The rating agencies defend their methodology and say that the problems of the mortgage-backed market, worth $10.4 trillion, are being exaggerated.S&P, which is owned by the McGraw-Hill, says it has had to downgrade only about 1 percent of the subprime mortgage debt the agency has rated in recent years, the overwhelming majority of the downgrades in the lowest-rated debt.Over the past 30 years, the average five-year default rate for investment-grade mortgage-backed bonds is less than 1 percent, said Chris Atkins, an S&P spokesman. ""Our long-term track record of assessing credit quality of bonds is exceptionally strong,"" he said.At Moody's, the amount of downgraded bonds is small compared with the total amount issued and has been focused on lower-rated securities, said Claire Robinson, a senior managing director. The downgraded bonds ""are riskier securities that are more prone to downgrade in a stressful environment,"" she added.Still, Richard Green, a finance professor at George Washington University, said he was mystified that risky home loans became bundled into triple-A-rated investments.""The problem is some of these mortgages were just phenomenally bad,"" he said. ""There was sort of an assumption that house prices would never fall. We now see some markets where they are falling quite a lot.""As home prices keep falling, rates that reset to higher levels on many loans could spark more defaults in the coming months.""Nobody was looking at the fundamentals,"" said Christopher Thornberg, a principal with Beacon Economics in Los Angeles. ""This was a brave new world.""Agencies that rated the bonds the investment banks were selling to investors ignored signs that borrowers were becoming too leveraged, he said, instead choosing to focus on borrowers credit scores.Bond funds typically diversify their investments to protect investors against losses in any one type of bond. The most risk-averse funds invest solely in U.S. Treasury bonds, while others buy corporate debt and mortgage-backed bonds that may have triple-A ratings but carry more risk than that of the government.Huge losses ""won't be the norm"" for most mutual funds, said Paul Herbert, a senior mutual fund analyst with the research firm Morningstar. But he does expect losses in investment-grade rated bonds backed by the worst-performing mortgages.Morningstar, in a report published last month, identified several mutual funds that had invested in short-term bonds, including subprime debt, that have suffered losses this year.Fidelity Advisor Ultra Short Bond A and Fidelity Ultrashort Bond, managed by Fidelity Investments, are both down nearly 5 percent for the year, a sharp drop for a fixed-income fund."
1,"PARIS —The European Central Bank president warned Monday of ""hectic behavior"" in the global economy and urged central bankers to keep a close eye on the United States for signs of an economic slowdown in the wake of a credit crunch that has rocked global financial markets.""This is no time for complacency,"" Jean-Claude Trichet, the ECB chief, said at a gathering in Basel, Switzerland, of the world's top central bankers, including the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and the Bank of Japan governor, Toshihiko Fukui. The current situation ""calls for close observation and monitoring,"" Trichet said.On Monday, fresh signs emerged that the U.S. economy, the world's largest, was being strained by a weakening housing market. Janet Yellen, the head of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said the current turmoil in financial markets had added to downside risks for the U.S. economy, while an influential group of economists cautioned of a risk that the United States could slide into recession.The warnings came as President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany stepped up calls for a European mechanism to achieve greater openness in financial markets, an initiative they first raised as trouble in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector threw financial markets into a tailspin in August.Last week, Trichet kept interest rates unchanged for the 13 nations that use the euro, emphasizing the credit squeeze and financial market turbulence as factors that might dampen the outlook for the European economy.Economists and bankers say the United States must ride out the turmoil to ensure that other nations avoid a serious downturn. But concerns are mounting over whether U.S. consumption will remain robust enough to keep its economy afloat.In a speech, Yellen warned that declining home prices could hurt consumer spending, and that risks to economic growth would be heightened if housing prices fell while unemployment rose. She said actions by the Fed to shore up the credit markets had been helpful, but were not a panacea.In another ominous note for global economic prospects, the International Monetary Fund managing director, Rodrigo de Rato, said of the crisis that the ""main bulk of the consequences should be in the U.S. economy,"" and he warned also that some of the Fund's 2008 economic growth would be lowered, reflecting the impact of financial market turbulence.In Europe, where the crisis already has had concrete repercussions - including a government-led bailout of a German bank, the sale of another state-owned German lender, and the temporary freezing of funds managed by the French bank BNP Paribas - Sarkozy said he would not accept speculative ""predators"" making profits at the expense of ""hundreds of thousands of jobs.""Merkel, speaking at the same meeting as Sarkozy in Meseberg, Germany, called for a joint European effort to seek to seek ""fair conditions"" in the transparency of international financial instruments.The two leaders said they expected final decisions on closer supervision of hedge funds and ratings agencies at a spring summit meeting in 2008 and would make the issue a top priority under the Portuguese presidency of the European Union next year.Analysts are watching all corners of the U.S. economy for signs that heavily indebted consumers - usually a motor of growth - are pulling back. In recent weeks, auto companies and Wall Street analysts have reduced their forecasts for auto sales because of a combination of factors, including high gasoline prices, consumer uncertainty and the crisis facing mortgage lenders.Last week, Robert Nardelli, the chief executive of Chrysler, said he was concerned that problems in the housing market and the broader economy were hurting car and truck sales. He said Chrysler was trying to anticipate what might await the industry, whose sales this year are expected to be the worst since 1998.Trichet and other central bankers are treading a difficult line over fallout from the sub-prime lending crisis in part because financiers these days use an increasingly complex toolbox of financial instruments to manage risk.Central bankers have been intervening by pumping huge quantities of low-cost money into the financial system to stave off a prolonged economic slowdown and reassure battered markets. At the same time, central bankers are seeking to avoid giving signals that reckless risk-takers will be bailed out if their investments are sufficiently big to pose a threat to the wider economy.The proper role for central banks is to ensure the ""correct functioning of the money market"" and keep close tabs on inflation, Trichet said, but he added that it was not their role to rescue investors who had made risky bets.""Bailing out bad investors would be the worst thing to do,"" Trichet said."
2,"BERLIN, Sept. 11 — The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said today that heavy saving by oil producers and Asian nations has helped depress interest rates by keeping financial markets flush with cash. But he warned against banking on this effect — one that probably helped create the current financial crisis — for the long term.In an annual lecture sponsored by Germany’s central bank, Mr. Bernanke skirted direct mention of the recent turmoil in financial markets, choosing instead to update a speech he gave two years ago. He cautioned that this influx of money would probably taper off “over the next few decades” as countries like China save less and consume more.Financial markets, however, have kept long-term interest rates low, a sign they apparently expect this effect to continue.“We are again reminded of the need to maintain appropriate humility in forecasting returns and asset prices,” Mr. Bernanke said.The “global savings glut,” a term that Mr. Bernanke coined two years ago to describe the historically peculiar phenomenon of an industrialized world awash in cash saved by developing countries, has helped fuel financial speculation by keeping interest rates low. Those low rates ensured that investors could borrow cheaply and invest in higher-yielding assets, including the securities backed by the now crisis-ridden subprime lending market in the United States that is threatening to drag down growth.Mr. Bernanke met with Chancellor Angela Merkel earlier in the day to discuss the American mortgage market crisis and the need for greater financial market transparency. But he declined to discuss these issues in remarks, citing the Fed’s silent period ahead of its coming policy meeting on Sept. 18.The Fed is expected to consider reducing its benchmark interest rate, from 5.25 percent, amid mounting signs the United States economy may slow as the credit crunch that roiled global markets tightens.The dollar has sunk in recent weeks as investors anticipate an interest rate cut, which would erode the value of dollar-denominated assets, and today was no exception to the trend. The dollar fell against the euro to within a few hundredths of a cent of the record low of $1.38 that it hit in late July.Though the crisis has been felt worldwide, policy makers in Europe today struck a largely upbeat tone, saying the European economy can weather the storm. But they warned in a new report that the financial market turmoil has “tilted the balance of risks clearly to the downside.”In a revised economic forecast released today, the European Commission said the 13-nation euro area will expand 2.5 percent in 2007, down from a prediction of 2.6 percent earlier this year. The full 27-nation European Union will grow by 2.8 percent instead of 2.9 percent, it said. It also revised its forecast for inflation slightly upward.“Looking at these figures we can conclude that maybe the peak of the cycle is behind us but we have still possibilities for a favorable situation in the coming quarters,” said the European Union’s economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Joaquin Almunia.A fuller picture should emerge as credit markets, which have periodically seized up as investors lost appetite for lending to anyone with exposure to the subprime market, begin to relax, the commission said.Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, also said today that the credit crunch has not affected Europe’s major players in finance. “It is important to remark that credit losses were not significant enough to materially impact the soundness of core financial institutions,” Mr. Trichet told the European Parliament.Last week, the European bank agreed to keep interest rates unchanged instead of lifting them as previously planned, and Mr. Trichet has cited the credit crisis and concerns that the United States economy might slow as factors that may in turn affect the mending European economy.In his remarks, Mr. Bernanke said that his thesis of a global savings glut helped keep down interest rates for the 10 years through 2004 is still broadly true. Though the mixture of current account surpluses and deficits in the world has shifted, the countries in surplus — notably China and major oil exporters — continue to invest that cash in the financial markets of the industrialized world.“My reading of recent developments is that although some of the details have changed, the fundamental elements of the global saving glut remain in place,” he said. “Most important, the emerging-market countries and oil producers remain large net suppliers of financial capital to global markets.”But that era cannot last forever, Mr. Bernanke emphasized.“The logic of the global saving glut suggests that, as the glut dissipates over the next few decades and thereby reduces the net supply of financial capital from emerging-market countries, real interest rates should rise,” Mr. Bernanke said.In his remarks, Mr. Bernanke focused on external imbalances which he said had widened over the last three years, and urged that the United States work with other countries to mend the jigsaw pattern to contribute to greater economic stability.To be sure, not everyone agrees these imbalances raise significant risks to the global economy.For example, the United States deficit, although worrisome, also largely reflect the attractiveness of both the American economy overall and the depth, liquidity and legal safeguards associated with its capital markets, Mr. Bernanke said.Current account imbalances also mitigate the risk of recession, he noted, citing the European economy, which benefited from running trade surpluses during a period of sluggish growth, and is seeing a decline now that the economy has recovered.Mr. Bernanke said the United States current account deficit was “certainly not sustainable at its current level,” but liabilities to foreigners were also not a burden on the American economy.“All that said,” Mr. Bernanke said, “the current pattern of external imbalances — the export of capital from the developing countries to the industrial economies, particularly the United States — may prove counterproductive over the longer term.”"

4,"BERLIN —The dollar breached a new low against major currencies Wednesday as investors bet that the Federal Reserve would soon cut interest rates and after a warning from the U.S. Treasury secretary that turbulence in financial markets might linger.The currency of the 13-nation euro zone rose to $1.3905 in 4 p.m. New York trading from 1.3835 late Tuesday. Earlier, the euro hit a record $1.3914, topping its previous record of $1.3852, reached July 24. The dollar also continued a prolonged fall against the pound and the yen.The Federal Reserve is expected to reduce borrowing costs next week as the credit crunch that recently roiled financial markets threatens to slow the world's largest economy.At the same time, inflation pressures appear to be mounting, as the price of oil and other commodities rise amid a continued increase in demand, especially from growing economies like China.On Wednesday, the price of crude oil futures closed at a record $79.91 a barrel, up $1.68, after hitting $80.18 a barrel during the day in New York after a report showed that supplies dropped the most this year. A decision Tuesday by the Organization for Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day failed to cap prices. Analysts said the increase was less than expected.""There's a feeling that OPEC waited too long to make this move,"" said Rick Mueller, an analyst with Energy Security Analysis in Wakefield, Massachusetts.Commodity prices in several markets also stayed in record territory Wednesday. Gold rose, as did wheat, which finished Tuesday just shy of $9 a bushel, an all-time peak.Increasing global demand and weather damage to crops have driven up prices in Chicago, a leading commodities exchange, by 79 percent this year. Users including Kellogg, the biggest U.S. cereal maker, General Mills and PT Indofood Sukses Makmur, the world's biggest producer of instant noodles, are responding by raising prices, fueling inflation.""The market is in a real frenzy,"" said Tobin Gorey, a commodity strategist with Commonwealth Bank of Australia in Sydney. ""It's feeding through to the consumer.""As consumers deal with rising food and energy costs, the housing and credit markets remain far from recovery. The U.S. Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., said Wednesday that financial market turmoil would take some time to be resolved, especially in the area of subprime mortgages.""We have been experiencing market turbulence, and as I have said for a while, it is going to take some time to work its way out,"" Paulson said at a meeting at the Treasury Department. ""We are going to work our way through this, in some markets more quickly than others.""The strength of the euro threatens to make European exports more expensive and therefore less competitive, although the currency's movements this year have been gradual rather than abrupt.The strong euro ""is weighing on growth,"" the French budget minister, Éric Woerth, said after a cabinet meeting in Paris on Wednesday.The dollar, which has hovered within a few cents of its record low over recent weeks amid the market turmoil caused by the subprime crisis, had come under new pressure since the U.S. Labor Department issued unexpectedly poor August jobs data Friday."
5,"VIENNA —OPEC sought to stamp its authority over volatile oil markets Tuesday, agreeing to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day. But prices held above $78 a barrel Wednesday after finishing at a record close of $78.23 a barrel Tuesday in New York.By midday in Europe on Wednesday, light, sweet crude for October delivery had risen 3 cents to $78.26 a barrel.At the same time, representatives of leading OPEC nations said they feared that a slowing global economy might damp future demand. The oil cartel signaled that it would be ready to act swiftly to protect its members' interests.[World oil demand will grow more slowly than expected in the last quarter of 2007 and next year, and high prices may further curb consumption, the International Energy Agency said Wednesday, Reuters reported from Vienna.[In its monthly Oil Market Report, the adviser to 26 industrialized countries said world demand would rise by 2.35 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, 240,000 barrels per day less than expected last month.[In lowering its demand estimates, the IEA cited weaker than expected consumption in June and July and said it was too early to assess the impact of fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis on the U.S. economy.]The decision by members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries came after an unusually long day of arguments about the size and the timing of the increase in production, intended to meet a surge in winter consumption and to push prices down.While the rise in crude oil supplies would be modest, about 2 percent, the announcement still came as a surprise to many. Some OPEC countries - including Iran, Venezuela and Algeria - had initially expressed strong opposition to an increase in supplies. Others feared that a mistimed decision to add oil to the market might backfire at a time of heightened economic concern.Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations brokered the deal during a seven-hour meeting here. Analysts said Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader and the group's biggest supplier, would be more comfortable with oil at around $70 a barrel. The production increase, the first official one in more than a year, will be effective on Nov. 1.Oil-consuming countries, including the United States, have been urging OPEC producers to add output to the market, warning that winter was expected to bring a big rise in consumption that oil producers outside OPEC would not be able to meet. They warned further that high oil prices could put an additional drag on the global economy.OPEC members stressed that they were being responsible and responsive.""Our message to consumers is that we care and we are concerned, and that is why we increased production,"" said Abdalla Salem el-Badri of Libya, the group's secretary general.Vera de Ladoucette of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said: ""The Saudis convinced other OPEC countries that $80 a barrel was a ceiling. They were really worried about contributing to the world economic crisis. They acted prudently.""And David Kirsch, an oil analyst at the consulting firm PFC Energy, said: ""OPEC is uncomfortable with a situation that takes control away from the fundamentals, and therefore from OPEC."""
6,"NEW YORK —Not long after the dot-com industry collapsed a few years ago, retailing became the hottest sector in commercial real estate. Online shopping was no longer viewed as a threat to bricks-and-mortar stores, and rising housing values made it easy for people to borrow more money - and spend it. Shopping centers began changing hands at ever-escalating prices.Two years ago, retail real estate began losing some of its allure for investors as the condo-conversion craze took over. More recently, investors have gravitated toward office buildings and hotels.Now many people in the retail real estate industry are bracing themselves for a slowdown in spending as the subprime mortgage crisis and the decline in housing values continue to send ripples through the economy.And shopping centers have been caught in the credit squeeze that has transformed the capital markets. Private buyers, who were once able to finance 95 percent or more of the cost of a transaction, are being driven out of the market because such high leverage is no longer available.According to investors, brokers and analysts, deals are taking longer to complete, and prices - at least for the second- and third-tier properties - are declining by as much as 10 percent.""What we have seen is a lull in the market, what you might call the calm before the storm,"" said Fritz McPhail, the owner of Blue Ridge Capital, an Atlanta real estate company that specializes in acquiring troubled strip malls. ""We are seeing prices change. We are seeing deals blow up. People are calling us back a second time to see if we want to consider another offer.""About 80 percent of the choice regional malls in the best locations are owned by publicly traded real estate investment trusts. Not surprisingly, they are expected to withstand the credit squeeze better than older shopping centers in less desirable settings.But even top mall operators are being affected by tighter lending standards.Two real estate investment trusts, the Simon Property Group and Macerich, agreed this year to sell three malls they have jointly owned for nearly a decade - Lindale Mall in Cedar Rapids, Iowa; NorthPark Mall in Davenport, Iowa; and SouthPark Mall in Moline, Illinois - to a private company that relies on a high degree of leverage. But the buyer was unable to complete the deal.Many retail specialists draw a distinction between shopping centers that cater to lower-income shoppers, who are more likely to lose their homes through foreclosure, and centers that serve more affluent customers. ""The upscale mall guys, while not completely insulated, should be better than the lower end,"" said Steve Sakwa, Merrill Lynch's analyst for real estate investment trusts. ""I don't think the credit crunch is really killing the people of Boca Raton.""Donald Wood, the chief executive of Federal Realty Investment Trust, a Rockville, Maryland, company that specializes in strip malls in inner-ring suburbs, where there is little land to be developed by competitors, said his company had not experienced an increase in vacancies. The future is likely to be less rosy for property owners in areas ""with less people, with less money and less barriers to entry,"" he said.Similarly, retail space in New York and other densely populated cities has continued to command high prices because ""you can't build very much of it,"" said Robert White Jr., of Real Capital Analytics, a New York research firm.With some big-box retailers like Home Depot reporting declining sales, shopping centers with such stores, known in the industry as power centers, may take a bigger hit than those whose tenants sell food and other necessities. ""The power centers are seeing the impact directly,"" said Jim Sullivan, an analyst at Green Street Advisors. ""There may be a perception that power centers are riskier than they had been.""Like residential mortgages, commercial mortgages are pooled, sorted into risk categories and sold as bonds.In the past several weeks, demand for these bonds has weakened, with investors demanding to be paid more for the risk. As a result, said Pete Bethea, a principal at Burnham Real Estate, a brokerage firm in San Diego, lenders are changing the terms of deals. ""Even if people thought they had their deal locked, there's no such thing,"" he said.Small-scale investors are being shut out, White of the New York research firm said. ""The trouble in the debt market is having an immediate impact on them,"" he said.As buyers are required to use more of their own equity, prices could fall as much as 15 percent but are not likely to slide much further, said Matthew Ostrower, a senior analyst for real estate investment trusts at Morgan Stanley. He said private equity funds had raised tens of millions of dollars to spend on real estate but were waiting for the gap to narrow between what sellers are asking and what they are willing to pay. ""Where that price is will be the collective decision of all these buyers,"" he said."
7,
8,"The dollar fell to a new low point against the euro yesterday and oil prices surged to a record, suggesting that a weaker American economy would be accompanied by higher prices for energy and other imported products.As of late yesterday, the euro traded in New York at $1.3908, up from $1.3832 late Tuesday; the European common currency has risen 5.4 percent against the dollar so far this year and about 1 percent this week.Crude oil prices rose more than 2 percent on the New York Mercantile Exchange, settling at $79.91 a barrel, after briefly trading above $80 — a day after OPEC said that its members would increase production by a modest amount.Taken together, these moves in the currency and commodities markets signaled more trouble for the American economy.Stock trading was light yesterday, and most indexes were modestly lower. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended essentially flat, and the Dow Jones industrial average declined a little more than 0.1 percent. Nasdaq and smaller-capitalization stocks were lower. Treasuries were down slightly, and the yield on the 10-year note rose to 4.41 percent, from 4.37 percent on Tuesday.Gold prices, little changed yesterday, have also surged in recent days as fears of an economic decline mounted and the dollar weakened. Gold futures are up 5.7 percent so far this month, to $714 an ounce in New York.Though the dollar has been falling against other currencies for much of the year, it has weakened significantly since Friday, when government data showed that businesses reduced net employment by 4,000 in August and that job growth had been weaker in June and July than previously thought.Investors widely expect the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark short-term interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, when it meets on Tuesday. There is even talk of a cut as much as a half-point.Ashraf Laidi, chief foreign currency analyst at CMC Markets in New York, commented, “The payroll report was seen as a macroeconomic justification.”Currencies are influenced by many factors, chief among them expectations for interest rates and inflation. If rates were to fall in the United States and remain unchanged in Europe, as many investors are expecting, traders will probably bid up the exchange value of euros.“The dollar is not in a great position,” said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Conn. “The confidence level is eroding in the face of the credit market crisis, which is very much subprime related and mortgage market related. And it is now complicated by the fact that the real economy is slowing.”For much of the year, the dollar has also been falling against the British pound and the Canadian, Australian and New Zealand dollars. The Japanese yen is up about 4 percent against the dollar so far in 2007, though it has lost some ground in the last few days.The weakening dollar has been a boon to exporters whose goods and services will become more competitive on the world market.Exports have been among the brightest spots in the American economy this year, growing 11.4 percent in the first eight months from the corresponding period of 2006. By comparison, imports were up 4.6 percent.The depreciating dollar has made imports more expensive. Energy commodities are expected to be chief among these.Oil prices, already near records set two months ago, have surged anew. The decision on Tuesday by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase production by 500,000 barrels a day, a relatively small quantity when compared with total production, appeared to make little difference.Yesterday, prices were also reacting to a government report that showed that crude oil inventories fell in the United States by 2.1 percent last week.More broadly and in the longer term, many analysts say that oil prices are poised to go higher because global demand for energy, led by China and India, is growing far faster than overall production, especially among oil producers that are not members of OPEC.“The combination of robust long-term demand growth and lagging non-OPEC supply suggests that strong support for oil prices is set to remain a feature of the markets beyond 2010,” Adam Sieminski, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote in a research note.Those higher prices, along with the increase in the prices of other imports, will provide another source of worry for the American economy and consumers. It could also complicate the Fed’s task, said Dustin Reid, a senior currency strategist at ABN Amro in Chicago. If inflation surges, policy makers would have a harder time justifying a big or prolonged series of rate cuts.“At some point, you are going to have the potential of importing inflation from around the globe,” Mr. Reid said. “And that’s likely to keep the Fed on guard.”"
9,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 12 (AP) — Secretary of the Treasury Henry M. Paulson Jr. said Wednesday that the turbulence in the financial markets would take some time to be resolved, especially in the area of subprime mortgages.Mr. Paulson, speaking to executives of big financial companies at a meeting at the Treasury Department, said the Bush administration was seeking their help in making sure that homeowners with subprime mortgages received assistance in dealing with sharply rising payments as their initial low adjustable rates were reset to higher levels.“We have been experiencing market turbulence, and as I have said for a while, it is going to take some time to work its way out,” Mr. Paulson said. “We are going to work our way through this, in some markets more quickly than others.”He added that “we are already seeing signs of improvements in a number of markets that have been experiencing stress.”But he said it was going to “take longer to work through the problems in the subprime market,” noting that many loans in this market were scheduled to be reset over the next two years.There are estimates that two million homeowners will face steep increases in their monthly payments, putting many of them at risk of losing their homes. The meeting here Wednesday was called as a follow-up to efforts announced by President Bush on Aug. 31 to provide some help to borrowers struggling to cope with mortgage payments.Among those attending the meeting with Mr. Paulson was Angelo R. Mozilo, chairman and chief executive of Countrywide Financial, the mortgage giant, which announced last week that it would lay off as much as 20 percent of its work force as it struggles with rising defaults.Other companies represented were Wells Fargo, CitiMortgage and JPMorgan Chase."
10,"FRANKFURT —Finance ministers and central bankers have long fretted that at some point, the rest of the world would lose its willingness to finance the United States' proclivity to consume far more than it produces - and that a potentially disastrous free-fall in the dollar's value would result.But for longer than most economists would have been willing to predict a decade ago, the world has been a willing partner in American excess - until a new and home-grown financial crisis this summer rattled confidence in the country, the world's largest economy.On Thursday, the dollar briefly fell to another low against the euro of $1.3927, as a slow decline that has been under way for months picked up steam this past week.""This is all pointing to a greatly increased risk of a fast unwinding of the U.S. current account deficit and a serious decline of the dollar,"" said Kenneth Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and an expert on exchange rates. ""We could finally see the big kahuna hit.""In addition to increased nervousness about the pace of the dollar's decline, many currency analysts now also are willing to make an argument they would have avoided as recently as a few years ago: that the euro should bear the brunt of the dollar's decline.The euro, shared by 13 countries, once looked like a daring experiment. But it has gained credibility and euro-denominated financial assets are as good as their U.S. counterparts. With a slow economic overhaul under way in European capitals, and a fundamentally sound corporate structure, a weaker dollar justifiably means a stronger euro.""The euro has earned what it has gotten,"" said Stephen Jen, global head of currency research at Morgan Stanley in London. ""It is not simply rallying by default.""So long as Americans buy more than they earn from exports - and they did, creating a current account deficit of $850 billion last year - the rest of the world financed the binge by bringing dollars into the United States for investment in stocks, bonds, real estate or other assets, thereby preserving demand for the dollar.The continued appetite for U.S. investments stemmed from a track record of strong economic growth and a financial system that has been remarkably resistant to shocks.But the latest turmoil in mortgage markets has, in a single stroke, shaken faith in the resilience of American finance to a greater degree than even the bursting of the technology bubble in 2000 or the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, analysts said. It has also raised prospect of a recession in the wider economy.While most economists just a few months ago would have dismissed the prospect of a dollar collapse outright, they now are debating the possibility that something on par with the dollar debacle of the 1970s might just happen again.When a currency collapses, the central bank can push up interest rates to attract needed investment, but strangle the economy in the process. Alternatively, it can let the currency fall and watch prices of imports - and eventually competing domestic goods - rise sharply.Double-digit inflation resulted in the 1970s and only a global recession brought it to an end.Today, the dollar's current weakness is being driven by uncertainty over how central banks will react to the turmoil in financial markets, unleashed by the collapse of the U.S. market for subprime mortgages given to borrowers with shaky credit histories.The European Central Bank put off an interest rate increase it had planned for September, but is still inclined to tighten credit at least one more time by the end of this year. By contrast, the U.S. Federal Reserve has hinted at a rate cut at its meeting next Tuesday - a step that would diminish the appeal of dollar-denominated assets, almost certainly sending the dollar lower.But across a horizon of 18 months to two years, investors are pondering how quickly the dollar will fall, a question to which there are no easy answers.After a run of strong growth, the U.S. economy has lurched into a phase of slower expansion, and last Friday the most serious warning sign appeared - an outright deterioration in employment growth.The data has coincided with profit warnings from major U.S. retailers like Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, suggesting that consumer spending, the backbone of the American economy for years, was ebbing. This step would logically follow the rapidly cooling housing market, since Americans have spent heavily with money borrowed against rising home values.A drop in consumer spending by Americans means fewer imports. The current account deficit peaked at 6.8 percent of gross domestic product in late 2005 and is now running at about 5.5 percent, with figures for the second quarter of 2007 due out on Friday.A lower deficit means less capital needs to flow into the United States, and is consistent with a steady decline in the dollar. Since the middle of last year, the dollar, weighted for trade flows, has fallen steadily against a broad range of currencies, according to data collected by the Fed.All this suggests that, in spite of headline-grabbing news about the latest low, the dollar could be adjusting gradually as the U.S. economy becomes driven less by lending on the back of rising home price.The problem, as every economist knows, is that the current account deficit - about $770 billion - is still colossal in absolute terms.And foreigners are being asked to provide those dollars at a time when the subprime turmoil is threatening to spill over into the broader economy.Put another way, at a time when the psychology of crisis has gripped financial markets, intangible attitudes toward the dollar have become all the more important. And with growth strong elsewhere in the world, there are appealing places to go besides the dollar.""The problem is that the deficit is still very, very large,"" Jen said. ""And there are plenty of other investment opportunities outside the United States.""Pressed to make an educated guess, most economists opt for calm, believing the dollar is unlikely to go into a tailspin even as they mark up the odds of one.The major holders of dollars - notably the Chinese, with their $1.3 trillion in currency reserves - have little incentive to see the dollar weaken, and their support provides the dollar with a bulwark of strength. And since investors need to stay diversified, and U.S. markets are deep and liquid, abandoning the dollar wholesale is hardly a realistic option.""Rather than a precipitous decline, we are probably be looking at a move steadily lower,"" said Simon Derrick, chief currency strategist at Bank of New York in London."
11,"NEW YORK —That there is a financial crisis is clear. What is not so clear is whether the medicine in Dr. Ben Bernanke's bag can do much good.Next week, the Federal Reserve is expected to make the first cut of the Bernanke era in the federal funds rate. The Wall Street debate is over whether that rate will be just a quarter percentage point below the current 5.25 percent, or whether the Fed will show its determination to act by cutting the rate by twice that amount.That the debate has gotten this far is evidence that the U.S. economy now seems much weaker than it did when Bernanke was testifying to Congress in July, just as the credit crunch was getting under way. Then he seemed to think there was no need for any cut at all, despite the crumbling housing market and the growing subprime mortgage problems.A new poll of corporate chief financial officers, taken by Duke University and CFO Magazine, shows a surge in pessimism. Nearly a third of the financial bosses say their companies have been hurt by the credit market turmoil.And few see much benefit to be had from Fed action. Nearly half think a cut of half a percentage point would not help their companies at all, and most of the rest see only a small benefit from such a move.For many companies, the immediate credit issue is not price, but availability. Can they borrow enough money to get by?The next part of the crisis could come from a company being unable to borrow enough money to pay off maturing commercial paper. The Fed can help there, with gentle urging to banks to not be overly tight in their lending standards, and there is reason to hope that problem will pass with banks taking on a lot more loans.But even if it does, there is the question of where companies will borrow in the future, whether to finance expansions or acquisitions, or just to raise capital if and when their business turns down. The credit markets were wide open just three months ago. Now they are all but shut to companies with speculative grade ratings. In the second quarter, the total volume of new junk bonds and leveraged loans averaged $88 billion a month. In August, the figure was $6.6 billion. That is a 93 percent decline.""For the first time in years the loan market is all but gridlocked,"" Standard & Poor's said this week in its leveraged company commentary. ""Demand has withered, forcing arrangers to put the massive calendar of underwritten deals on ice.""That has happened, it may be noted, with virtually no defaults on corporate loans. But the majority of such loans were funded through securitizations, in which the risk was sliced and diced in ways that enabled most of the money to be put up by investors who bought securities rated AAA, the highest possible rating.Sometimes those ratings were a bit off. Three weeks ago, one such security still had AAA ratings, but since then Moody's has cut it twice, and it is now in the nether regions of junk, rated Caa2, with Moody's warning it could go lower. It's sort of like going from class valedictorian to remedial reading failure.Most of the weird securities that got AAA ratings - this one was described as a ""variable leveraged super senior certificate"" and was backed by a variety of other structured finance securities - will probably turn out to be safe. But no one knows which ones, and few are willing to risk cash on a basis that would allow new debts to be securitized.The old method for pricing risk, which relied on the old securitization methods, is dead. A new one is not yet here. Eventually, perhaps, a safer and more cautious securitization market will develop. In the meantime, banks may be willing to make more loans to risky borrowers, or perhaps institutional investors will step up to fund corporate loans directly. But until some part of that happens, the credit crunch is on.Lowering the fed funds rate will not hurt. It will make it cheaper for high-quality borrowers to raise money, and some of that will filter down. But it will not address the issues that have caused credit to tighten. Nor will it get us closer to learning just where prices will settle - whether for homes or companies - in an era when risky loans are no longer easy to come by."
12,"LONDON —The dollar fell to an all-time low versus the euro Thursday on speculation that signs of slowing U.S. economic growth will prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates next week, narrowing the rate advantage over Europe.Though it recovered in later trading, the dollar was poised for its longest streak of declines since October 2004 as investors increased bets that the Fed will reduce its target rate on Sept. 18.After falling against other major currencies for much of the year, the dollar's decline picked up speed significantly starting Friday, when U.S. government data showed that businesses reduced net employment by 4,000 in August and that job growth had been weaker in June and July than previously thought.""Over all, we're still in a weak dollar environment,"" said Mitul Kotecha, head of currency strategy at Calyon in London. ""Concerns about the U.S. economy have intensified, and that's played negatively for the dollar.""The euro touched $1.3920 in London trading before retreating to $1.3884 in midday trading, down from $1.3913 late Wednesday in New York. The dollar rose to ¥114.80 from ¥114.12, while the pound eased to $2.0263 from $2.0310.Besides the dollar's weakness, markets are worried also about the price of oil. Crude oil for October delivery was at $79.78 a barrel Thursday. It touched $80.18 on Wednesday, its highest intraday price since trading began in 1983, on concern storms in the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic may disrupt output.Traders also added to bets that the European Central Bank will raise interest rates from the current 4 percent to curb rising prices as crude oil advanced.""Oil is surging, so there's an upside risk to inflation in Europe,"" said Hideaki Inoue, chief manager of derivatives and fixed-income investment at Mitsubishi UFJ Trust & Banking in Tokyo. ""The ECB is hawkish, so rates are likely to go up.""If U.S. rates were to drop while European rates remained unchanged or even rose, as many investors are expecting, traders would probably further bid up the value of euro.Interest-rate futures show a 74 percent likelihood the Fed will lower borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.75 percent. A month ago, traders expected a quarter-point cut.Central bankers and economists are worried that a squeeze on credit caused by concern over losses linked to subprime mortgages may have negative consequences on the U.S. economy.""The subprime loan problem is the main worry for investors,"" said Xing Wei of Shinsei Bank in Tokyo.Banks and companies are seeking to refinance about $700 billion worth of commercial paper in the U.S. currency this week, according to analysts at Citigroup. Borrowers in the commercial paper market are struggling to sell new notes because of concern some of the short-term debt is linked to subprime-mortgage assets.""The dollar is not in a great position,"" said David Gilmore, a partner at Foreign Exchange Analytics in Essex, Connecticut. ""The confidence level is eroding in the face of the credit market crisis, which is very much subprime related and mortgage market related. And it is now complicated by the fact that the real economy is slowing."""

14,"LONDON, Sept. 14 —British financial authorities said today that they had extended an emergency loan to rescue a big mortgage bank, as the effects of a global credit crunch stemming from the crisis in the American subprime lending business spread to one of the world’s most buoyant housing markets.The British government said it had authorized the Bank of England to provide a “liquidity support facility” of unspecified size to Northern Rock, a mortgage lender based in Newcastle, England, that has expanded aggressively in recent years.The news prompted a sell-off in the shares of Northern Rock and other British bank stocks as investors worried about the possibility of similar problems at other institutions, as well as threats to the broader economy.The FTSE 100 share index had fallen by more than 130 points by around noon in London today.Northern Rock’s need for emergency financing represents a significant broadening of the effects of the crisis in global financial markets, analysts said, because until now problems at European banks have stemmed mostly from their direct exposure to United States subprime loans.Northern Rock, by contrast, said it had only a small amount of subprime loans in its portfolio, and British regulators said it “has a good quality loan book.”Instead, it ran into problems when the squeeze in capital markets undermined the bank’s business model. Northern Rock has relied heavily on raising money in the capital markets, rather than consumer bank deposits, to finance its mortgage lending.With other banks increasingly reluctant to extend new credit, Northern Rock said it faced the possibility of being unable to meet existing obligations.“The problems are potentially much wider now,” said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy in London. “This means we have to worry about a wider range of institutions that aren’t directly involved in this credit crisis, but are in a way innocent bystanders.”The move came only two days after Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, warned that moves by other central banks, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which pumped extra liquidity into the financial system in recent weeks, could encourage “excessive risk-taking” by rewarding bad behavior.The Bank of England emphasized Friday that its lending to Northern Rock would be conducted at a premium to market interest rates."

""First-time buyer activity seems pretty certain to show a sharp fall, which, since the whole market rests on the shoulders of the first-time buyer, is like throwing a spanner in the works of the whole market.""While the British housing market has soared over the last decade, repeatedly defying many analysts' warnings that valuations were overstretched, there have been some signs of a slowdown lately.

16,"LONDON —The Bank of England has offered an emergency loan to Northern Rock after the mortgage lender became the biggest British casualty so far of the credit squeeze sparked by the crisis in U.S. subprime mortgage markets.Britain's finance minister said on Friday he had authorised the Bank of England to provide an unspecified amount of financial support to Northern Rock, which was the country's biggest mortgage lender in the first half of this year.While it has no exposure to subprime loans, Northern Rock has proved vulnerable to the liquidity squeeze triggered by the U.S. subprime lending crisis because it has a small deposit base and so has to draw most of its funding from money markets.Interbank lending costs rose to their highest level for nine years this week as banks scaled back lending to each other.Northern Rock said on Friday a decision to rein back lending and the higher cost of funding would hit profits this year and next. It said it now expected an underlying 2007 pretax profit of £500 to £540 million, or $1.1 billion, compared with analysts' current consensus forecast of 647 million.It also expected a ""consequential impact"" on 2008 profit.""The decision to provide a liquidity support facility to Northern Rock reflects the difficulties that it has had in accessing longer term funding and the mortgage securitisation market, on which Northern Rock is particularly reliant,"" the government said in a statement on Friday written in conjunction with the Bank of England and Financial Services Authority (FSA).""The FSA judges that Northern Rock is solvent, exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book,"" it added.The Bank of England said earlier this week it would not bail out insolvent institutions."
17,"LONDON —A bailout of a big British mortgage bank caused shudders among account-holders and investors alike Friday, opening a new phase in the global financial turmoil that emanated from a shakeout in the U.S. home lending business, analysts said.Depositors flocked to withdraw money after the bank, Northern Rock, unable to raise funds from its usual sources - capital markets - because of the global credit crunch, turned to the Bank of England for an emergency loan. Northern Rock shares plunged more than 30 percent, prompting a broader sell-off in European stock markets.While other European banks have gotten burned by investments tied to shaky U.S. mortgages, known as subprime, Northern Rock said it had only a small subprime exposure in its portfolio.

Shares elsewhere in Europe fell less sharply.""I don't think the worst is behind us,"" Jean-Claude Juncker, who chaired a meeting of European finance ministers and central bankers Friday, said during a news conference in Porto, Portugal, Reuters reported.The U.S. Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank have been under pressure to keep key interest rates low or even cut them as the market turmoil threatens to choke economic growth. The Bank of England has raised its rates several times in recent months to try to cool a frothy housing market, which while driving economic growth has also raised fears of a bubble.The emergency loan to Northern Rock came only two days after Mervyn King, the governor of the Bank of England, warned that moves by other central banks, like the Fed and ECB, to pump extra cash into the financial system in recent weeks could encourage ""excessive risk-taking"" by rewarding bad behavior.On Friday, the Bank of England emphasized that Northern Rock would have to pay a premium to market interest rates for its emergency credit line, offered under the central bank's role as ""lender of last resort.""""Northern Rock is solvent, exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book,"" the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury said in a joint statement.But those words failed to soothe some Northern Rock customers. Account-holders rushed to branches throughout Britain, many of them reportedly withdrawing large amounts of money.Outside a Northern Rock branch in central London, Constance Hackford, a manager at an interior design firm, weighed joining a line of about two dozen people.""I can't imagine the Bank of England is going to let it fail - can they?"" she said. ""I've got rather a lot of money in there. Maybe I should spread my bets a bit.""A spokesman for Northern Rock said Friday afternoon that the bank did not have any estimates yet of the amount that had been withdrawn.Because Northern Rock - and, perhaps, other British mortgage lenders - will now have to pay more to raise money for loans, they will have to pass along higher interest rates to consumers, analysts say.

But the bank on Friday also downgraded its profit outlook for this year and next year.""I don't expect us to move back to the volume of lending we were doing before,"" Applegarth said. ""I think those volume days are in the past.""He said the bank, whose level of residential lending in the first eight months of the year was 55 percent higher than a year earlier, had been more aggressive than some of its rivals in using ""wholesale funding"" rather than deposits to back its loans.Analysts said the bank's business model was based on issuing large numbers of loans, with thin margins between the rates it charged mortgage-holders and those that it paid for its funding. Northern Rock converted from a ""building society,"" or member-owned lender, to a publicly traded bank a decade ago.""With hindsight, if we had seen this coming, would we have run the same strategy? No,"" Applegarth said. ""But hindsight is a great thing, and I don't think anybody else saw this coming either.""Northern Rock said it had only £75 million, or $150 million, in direct exposure to the U.S. subprime market, with £200 million in exposure to U.S. collateralized debt obligations, some of which was indirectly exposed to the subprime market. But together, that represents less than one-quarter of one-percent of the bank's total assets, it said.That distinguishes Northern Rock from other European banks, like BNP Paribas in France and IKB Deutsche Industriebank in Germany, which were hurt by large direct exposure to the U.S. subprime market.But with banks increasingly reluctant to issue anything other than short-term credit, Northern Rock faced the possibility of being unable to meet existing obligations.Northern Rock approached the central bank, Applegarth said, because of the ""astonishing"" conditions in the markets that it had used to raise financing, and because ""we could see no end to this in the short term.""Some analysts said Northern Rock could now become a takeover target.Others said the bank could emerge intact from the current turmoil, assuming the credit crunch eases.While repossessions of homes have been rising in Britain over the last year, Northern Rock has a generally sound portfolio, they said. Less than one-half of 1 percent of the bank's mortgage loans are more than three months in arrears, Northern Rock said. That is less than half the British industry average.""We think there is a strong bank here, but with a vulnerability, which is its sources of funding,"" said Matthew Taylor, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded some of the bank's credit ratings Friday.At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Portugal, officials said the fallout of the recent market turbulence would be limited for the real economy.""We're all aware the risks of lower growth have increased,"" European Economic and Monetary Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said, according to Reuters.But he, Juncker and the ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, all stuck to forecasts of only marginally lower growth this year than the 2.7 percent rise in gross domestic product seen in 2006,"

20,"Merrill Lynch warned yesterday that shaky credit markets forced it to reduce the value of securities linked to risky subprime mortgages and other products, a move that could hurt third-quarter profit.Merrill shares initially fell 3.5 percent on the news, but recovered most of the loss before closing at $74.65, down 49 cents, or 0.65 percent.The announcement was a potential danger signal for other large American brokerage firms and investment banks that report earnings next week. Some Wall Street heavyweights like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers could be affected.Kathleen Shanley, an analyst at the independent fixed-income research firm GimmeCredit, said she was disappointed that Merrill did not provide more details.Merrill Lynch is one of the largest issuers of collateralized debt obligations. Its investment bank also packages pools of subprime loans into securities for investors, and Merrill is exposed to the crisis in the subprime lending industry through its First Franklin Financial unit.Merrill paid $1.3 billion for First Franklin in late December, and some analysts have said they expected the company to write down a portion of that amount.Merrill Lynch’s retained stake in securitized assets, including residential mortgages packaged into bonds, was $10.3 billion at the end of June.Merrill Lynch said it made the disclosure in anticipation of closing its acquisition of First Republic Bank, which is scheduled for next Friday."
21,"LONDON, Sept. 14 — Depositors of a big British mortgage lender, Northern Rock, rushed to withdraw money on Friday after the bank, unable to raise financing because of the tight credit market, turned to the Bank of England for an emergency loan.Nervous investors also dumped Northern Rock shares, which fell 31 percent.The bailout, analysts said, was the latest indication that the turmoil that began in the subprime market in the United States had expanded into other areas.While other European banks have been hurt by investments in financial vehicles backed by subprime loans, Northern Rock said it had limited subprime exposure.Instead, the bank ran into trouble because the tighter credit undermined its business model, which relied on financing mortgages by raising money in the capital markets, rather than depending on consumer deposits.“The problems are potentially much wider now,” said Jonathan Loynes, an economist at Capital Economics, a consulting firm in London. “This means we have to worry about a wider range of institutions that aren’t directly involved in this credit crisis but are in a way innocent bystanders.”The bailout came two days after the governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, warned that moves by other central banks, like the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, which have pumped additional liquidity into the system, could encourage “excessive risk-taking” by rewarding bad behavior.The Bank of England emphasized Friday that Northern Rock would have to pay a premium to market interest rates for its emergency credit line, offered under the bank’s role as “lender of last resort.”“Northern Rock is solvent, exceeds its regulatory capital requirement and has a good quality loan book,” the Bank of England, the Financial Services Authority and the Treasury said in a joint statement. But those words did not mollify some Northern Rock customers. Account holders lined up at many of the bank’s 70-plus branches, many of them reportedly withdrawing large sums.Outside a branch in central London, Constance Hackford, a manager at an interior design company, weighed joining a line of about two dozen people. “I can’t imagine the Bank of England is going to let it fail — can they?” she said.A spokesman for Northern Rock said Friday that the bank did not have any estimates yet of how much money had been withdrawn.One reason Northern Rock customers may be nervous is that there is less protection for account holders in Britain than in the United States in case a bank fails. Deposits are insured up to £31,700, or about $64,000, compared with up to $100,000 in the United States.Adam J. Applegarth, chief executive of Northern Rock, said account holders should not worry. “I’m a depositor with Northern Rock,” he said in a conference call. “Knowing that we have an uncapped facility with the Bank of England — you don’t get better than the Bank of England.” Because Northern Rock — and, perhaps, other British mortgage lenders — will have to pay more to raise money for loans, they will have to pass along higher rates to consumers, analysts say.

A survey released this week by the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, a real estate group, showed that prices in August fell in more areas of Britain than they rose. Several banks have increased lending rates.Mr. Applegarth said Northern Rock would cut back on issuing new loans, as well as cutting costs through a hiring freeze and other steps. The bank on Friday downgraded its profit outlook for this year and next year.He said the bank, whose level of residential lending in the first eight months was 55 percent higher than a year earlier, had been more aggressive than some of its rivals in using “wholesale funding” rather than deposits to back its loans.Northern Rock said it had £75 million ($152 million) in direct exposure to the subprime market, with £200 million ($405 million) in exposure to collateralized debt obligations, some of which is exposed to the subprime market.Together, that represents less than one-quarter of 1 percent of the bank’s total assets, it said.Northern Rock approached the central bank, Mr. Applegarth said, because of the “astonishing” conditions in the markets that it had used to raise financing, and because “we could see no end to this in the short term.”Some analysts said Northern Rock could become a takeover target while others said the bank could emerge intact, assuming that credit problems ease.While repossessions of homes have been rising in Britain, analysts said that Northern Rock has a generally sound mortgage portfolio. Fewer than one-half of 1 percent of the bank’s mortgage loans are more than three months in arrears, Northern Rock said; that is less than half the British industry average.“We think there is a strong bank here, but with a vulnerability, which is its sources of funding,” said Matthew Taylor, an analyst at Fitch Ratings, which downgraded some of the bank’s credit ratings Friday."
22,"PARIS, Sept. 17  Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said today that turmoil in the world’s financial markets could continue for some time. But he cautioned against the hasty introduction of new regulations that could stymie innovation and slow economic growth.Mr. Paulson, who met in Paris with President Nicolas Sarkozy of France and the finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said financial turbulence after a credit crisis this summer “will be with us for a while,” particularly in markets linked to subprime mortgages.But Mr. Paulson also warned that imposing new regulations could be counterproductive at a time when the global economy remains robust.“The whole world and the U.S. have benefited from innovative financing techniques and innovation in terms of securitization and credit availability, and so we need to think this through carefully and don’t rush to judgment and overreact,” Mr. Paulson said. “We have to get the balance right.”During his trip to Paris, which is being followed by a trip to London to meet with Alistair Darling, Britain’s chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr. Paulson appeared to endorse Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Frenchman, to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Paulson said he already saw eye to eye with Mr. Strauss-Kahn over the need to change the I.M.F. so that the institution could play a continuing role in the global financial system. “I am very positive on Dominique Strauss-Kahn,” Mr. Paulson said, adding that he is “a very strong candidate.”Mr. Paulson also said his visit to Paris marked “a new, very positive era of American and French relations.” He praised President Sarkozy for undertaking changes aimed at creating jobs and at bolstering economic growth and said he was in frequent contact with Ms. Lagarde over major economic questions.Ms. Lagarde, speaking later with reporters, said France and the United States were in complete agreement over the need to press China to do more to strengthen the value of its currency.“I think there is a total convergence of views on the imbalance of the values, particularly on the undervaluation of the yuan compared with European values and compared with American values,” she said.Ms. Lagarde said the sudden worsening of the credit crisis late last week in Britain, when the housing lender Northern Rock had to call on the Bank of England for emergency financing, was unlikely to be a signal that of further problems to come in France.The “situation with our large French banks is solid,” she said. “Especially compared with German banks, French banks are in a very good position.”"
23,"PARIS —The U.S. Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., said Monday that turmoil on the world's financial markets could continue for some time. But he cautioned against the hasty introduction of regulations that could stymie innovation and slow economic growth.Paulson, who met with the President Nicolas Sarkozy and Finance Minister Christine Lagarde of France in Paris, said financial turbulence following a credit crisis this summer ""will be with us for a while,"" particularly in markets linked to subprime mortgages.Paulson also warned that imposing new regulations could be counterproductive at a time when the global economy remained robust.""The whole world and the U.S. have benefited from innovative financing techniques and innovation in terms of securitization and credit availability, and so we need to think this through carefully and don't rush to judgment and overreact,"" Paulson said. ""We have to get the balance right.""Paulson hinted, however, that some action might be necessary to ensure better oversight of hedge funds. ""We are not accepting the status quo,"" said Paulson, who indicated a need to introduce more transparency in the way that hedge funds operate.During his trip to Paris, which is being followed by a trip to London to meet with Alistair Darling, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, Paulson appeared to endorse Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French candidate to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund.Paulson said he already saw eye-to-eye with Strauss-Kahn over the need to reform the IMF so that it could play a continuing role in the global financial system. ""I am very positive on Dominique Strauss-Kahn,"" Paulson said, adding that he was ""a very strong candidate.""Paulson also said his visit to Paris marked ""a new, very positive era of American and French relations."" He praised Sarkozy for undertaking regulatory changes aimed at creating jobs and increasing economic growth, and said he was in frequent contact with Lagarde over key economic questions.Lagarde, speaking later with reporters, said France and the United States were in complete agreement over the need to pressure the Chinese leadership to do more to strengthen the value of the yuan.""I think there is a total convergence of views on the imbalance of the values, particularly on the undervaluation of the yuan compared with European values and compared with American values,"" Lagarde said."
24,"LONDON —Terry Mays and his wife, both British retirees, decided during the weekend that a promise by the Bank of England to provide emergency financing for Northern Rock, the troubled British mortgage lender that has most of their savings, was not sufficient to calm their nerves.The couple joined hundreds of other Northern Rock customers Monday as lines formed for a third day in front of branches where people waited to withdraw their savings.""I don't think the bank will collapse - but we just don't have the nerves,"" he said, surrounded by a group of depositors who had traveled with him to the central London branch from a southern one after being told that the wait there would be at least six hours. ""I took some financial advice over the weekend, and I'm taking the money out to get peace of mind. We're relying on this money for our pension.""Panicky customers have withdrawn an estimated £2 billion, or $4 billion, since the bank acknowledged Friday that it no longer could raise funds because of the credit crunch that has squeezed global markets following a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States.Unlike other banks that have been bailed out because of direct exposure to subprime mortgages, Northern Rock was the first to directly fall victim to the global credit squeeze, because it relied heavily on raising funds in the capital markets.Shares in Northern Rock slumped 33 percent Monday to a seven-year low, dragging European banking stocks lower across the board as jittery investors began scrutinizing banks to determine which ones might have a similar business model.Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley, two Northern Rock rivals that also tap the capital markets for funding, fell 18 percent and 8 percent respectively Monday. Major financial institutions, including HSBC Holdings, Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany also declined, leading a 1.3 percent drop of the European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. The FTSE 100 in Britain fell 1.2 percent, and the CAC in France fell 1.6 percent.Northern's woes ricocheted back to the United States, where Citigroup fell 71 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $45.93 in afternoon trading. The S&P 500 fell 0.56 percent.The overnight rate British banks charge to lend pounds to one another soared 60 basis points to 6.47 percent Monday, the highest level in more than a month, according to the British Bankers' Association.Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch cut their earnings estimates for several European banks Monday, including Northern Rock. Credit Suisse and Merrill said the bank was likely to be bought.""We think the game is over for Northern Rock in its present form,"" a Merrill analyst, John-Paul Crutchley, wrote in a note to investors.The specter of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also sparked a raft of questions about whether the robust British economy - supported in large part by a heated housing market - would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. The pound fell below $2 for the first time in nearly three weeks.Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British economic growth. Members of Britain's opposition Conservative party Monday blamed Prime Minister Gordon Brown for ignoring warnings of a ""looming debt crisis"" for the past four years and for encouraging consumers to take on record debt when he was chancellor of the Exchequer during this period.In recent years, British mortgage lenders began offering loans exceeding the value of the properties on which they were based. The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices and fueled speculation in the real estate market.Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only days after refusing to inject liquidity into cash-starved financial markets on the basis that such action encouraged ""excessive risk-taking.""So far, assurances from the Northern Rock chief executive, Adam Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of England, have failed to impress depositors. In a bid to shore up confidence, Darling announced Monday that the government would guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other troubled financial institution that approached the government. No other bank or institution had yet approached the Bank of England, he added.Some of those waiting in line to retrieve their savings Monday blamed what they called lax standards at both U.S. and British mortgage lenders for the shortage of funds at Northern Rock.""We had to go through a lengthy process to get a mortgage that was barely more than we earned, and now my son's girlfriend can get double that with hardly any income,"" said one customer, who declined to give his name but said he planned to withdraw his entire savings of more than £100,000. ""That's just not right.""Northern Rock opened at 8 a.m. Monday, one hour earlier than usual, to deal with the expected wave of withdrawals. It had to increase the bandwidth on its Web site, which had struggled with the volume of people trying to access it.Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw her money after watching the morning news and seeing new lines forming at the bank branches.""I hate to take out the money, but I just don't want to risk anything,"" she said, adding that she did not yet know what she would do with it.Troubles at Northern Rock filled the top headlines in the British press, further spreading nervousness. The BBC wrote on its Web site that clients were besieging branches, while The Evening Standard said that savers had pushed the bank to the ""brink of extinction.""""People are mortified and if savers are continuing to withdraw funds, a sale or split up becomes more likely,"" said Christine Ross, head of financial planning at SG Hambros in London. Large clearing banks like Lloyds, Barclays, HSBC Holdings and Royal Bank of Scotland might profit by scooping up former Northern Rock customers, she said.Jonathan Pierce, a banking analyst at Credit Suisse in London, said that the most likely scenario for Northern Rock was a sale to another bank either ""as a business or division of assets."" Yet, the difficulties have ""severely dented"" the brand, he said.Some customers, including Mays, wished they had the nerves to keep some savings with Northern Rock and wait for the bank to be bought. ""There was speculation that whoever buys it could offer incentives for customers to leave their money in there,"" Mays said. ""But the thing is, you just don't know."""
25,"SINGAPORE —Developing Asian economies will expand faster than estimated in 2007 and 2008, and are expected to be able to weather any U.S. slowdown and turmoil in global credit markets, the Asian Development Bank said Monday.Growth in Asia excluding Japan and Australia is predicted to be 8.3 percent this year, beating a March estimate of 7.6 percent, the Manila-based lender said in a report. The region will expand 8.2 percent in 2008, faster than an earlier forecast of 7.7 percent, according to the ADB, which is funded by governments to promote development in the region.Rising incomes in China and India, the world's two fastest-growing major economies, are bolstering consumer and corporate spending. External debt has fallen since the 1997 Asian financial crisis while foreign-exchange reserves have risen sevenfold to $3.6 trillion, and the ADB said the region was better placed to cope with adverse developments.""Developing Asia's defenses against external shocks are solid and it can weather a slowdown in the U.S.,"" said Ifzal Ali, chief economist at the ADB. ""It has stout financial defenses and some scope for policy adjustment.""The global credit crisis sparked by the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market shook equity markets around the world, sending benchmark indexes plunging as investors withdrew from riskier investments. The Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia Pacific index tumbled 15 percent from its record high on July 24 to a seven-month low on Aug. 17. It has since rebounded 11 percent.While volatility in credit markets is making the outlook for growth more ""hazy,"" the bank said the region's growth would depend on how domestic challenges were met.""While the jury is still out on the events unfolding in credit markets and the broader global economy, a sharp dive in Asia's economic growth still seems unlikely,"" according to the Asian Development Outlook 2007 Update report.Still, the region is not entirely immune to a U.S. recession. Developing Asian nations are almost twice as reliant on exports as the rest of the world, with 60 percent of their sales abroad ultimately destined for the United States, Europe and Japan.""A steep downturn in the U.S., with knock-on effects in Japan and the euro zone, would mark a significant deterioration in the external environment and would undoubtedly cut into regional growth going into 2008,"" Ali wrote. But any impact would be ""modest and short-lived,"" he said.A recession in the world's largest economy would reduce the Asian region's growth rate by as much as 2 percentage points, the ADB said.Global economic expansion may suffer a modest slowdown to about 4.75 percent should growth in the United States slip below 2 percent from an average of 2.3 percent in the first half, forecasters at Morgan Stanley, Global Insight and the Economist Intelligence Unit predicted. Contagion from a U.S. recession would cut global growth to 3.5 percent or less.More currency flexibility is needed to help policy makers address economic imbalances, the ADB said.""Some countries are trying to juggle too many objectives given the instruments at their disposal,"" the ADB said. ""While exchange-rate regimes are certainly more flexible than they once were, there is scope for still-greater flexibility.""""Robust"" momentum in the economies of China and India is driving Asian expansion, curbing the impact of any easing of demand for the region's goods.The ADB raised its 2007 forecast for economic growth in China to 11.2 percent from 10 percent, estimated six months ago. It increased its prediction for expansion in India to 8.5 percent from 8 percent, estimated in March.Chinese and Indian policy makers can be expected to remain alert on inflation pressures, the ADB said. China raised interest rates on Friday for the fifth time since March to curb the fastest inflation rate since 1996 and to cool a surging stock market.China is trying to prevent overheating without triggering a sudden slowdown that could cost jobs and leave factories idle, and more measures are expected.The Reserve Bank of India is likely to hold off any interest-rate reductions, the ADB said."
26,"LONDON —The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King, has spent the past month trying to stay above the fray as the U.S. subprime mortgage collapse upset credit markets. Now he is getting dragged in, whether he likes it or not.Two days after King told lawmakers last week that central banks should avoid giving the impression they would help lenders that made bad decisions, the Bank of England provided emergency funds to Northern Rock in the biggest bailout of a British bank in three decades.""It's a crisis of confidence, and the bank is confused,"" said Patrick Minford, an economics professor at Cardiff University who advised former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. ""They want to be hands-off, but in this situation they can't be. I don't think this has done King any good.""King's credibility is in question for his refusal to emulate other central banks and take early action to help cash-strapped lenders. With Northern Rock's failure, he is finding himself subject to the same charge of excessive caution being leveled at Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve, whose office adjoined King's at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the 1980s.""There's no doubt that had the Bank of England acted early, Northern Rock would not have had the same problems,"" said Stephen Bell, chief economist at the hedge fund GLC in London. ""The idea they can't do anything about it is clearly wrong.""King, a former London School of Economics professor whose five-year term ends June 30, initially underestimated the threat posed by rising defaults on mortgages to U.S. borrowers with poor credit histories. It was ""not an international financial crisis,"" he said Aug. 8; the next day, credit markets seized up as concern about exposure to subprime losses made banks reluctant to lend to each other.The European Central Bank has loaned cash to banks in seven special auctions since then, and the Federal Reserve responded to criticism that its response was too slow by cutting the rate at which it lends directly to banks on Aug. 17. Economists are predicting that the Federal Reserve will reduce its benchmark rate Tuesday by at least a quarter point.King held back until markets forced his hand. Last week he said that too much help ""encourages excessive risk-taking, and sows the seeds of a future financial crisis."" With three-month money-market rates close to a nine-year high, the bank made its first additional cash loan to banks on Friday. The next day, it rescued Northern Rock after rising credit costs left the British mortgage provider unable to make new loans.""Is this the right environment to be so sanctimonious and to take such a hard line?"" asked James Knightley, an economist at ING Financial Markets in London. ""If you play this moral high ground, it could backfire.""The criticism of King could hardly come at a worse moment if he wants to be reappointed. The only member of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee to vote on each rate decision since 1997, King has been overruled by his colleagues twice in the past two years, and in March was forced to write a letter to Brown after inflation accelerated to a decade-high of 3.1 percent. It has since receded: Consumer prices rose just 1.9 percent in July.Nor is the timing helpful to Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who as chancellor of the Exchequer gave the central bank rate-setting independence 10 years ago.While Brown and the Bank of England have overseen Britain's longest period of economic growth in two centuries, consumer debt has also surged over the last decade: Households are now shouldering a record £1.3 trillion in debt. In addition, the Bank of England's benchmark rate of 5.75 percent is the highest among the Group of Seven nations, and London house prices fell the most in three years in September, a report from Rightmove showed last week.King's defenders say the Bank of England's stance on the credit turmoil, which he outlined in testimony to British lawmakers last week, will be proven wise over time. ""King is an intellectual colossus, and I'd have no qualms about reappointing him,"" said Geoffrey Dicks, chief U.K. economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group in London. His statement ""was almost a gem.""King, an architect of the bank's inflation-targeting strategy, has won plaudits for helping end Britain's decades-long fight with rising prices. He became chief economist in 1991 and was named governor in 2003."
27,"NEW YORK —On Wall Street, now more so than any time in recent memory, everyone is holding their breath and fearing the worst.Four of the biggest U.S. investment banks will report third-quarter earnings in the next several days. Everyone - from traders on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange to highly paid bankers perched in corner offices - is looking for any kind of sign these financial institutions have weathered one of the rockiest markets in years.Goldman Sachs Group, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers Holdings, and Bear Stearns have been squeezed by turmoil in the mortgage industry and tightening credit conditions. Their results will provide a badly needed first glimpse into the health of the global financial market.The investment banks, along with other financial firms, make up about a quarter of the Standard & Poor's 500 index. It is a long-held belief that this group must show strength in order for the blue-chip index to advance - and anything less could extend the volatile conditions that marred most of the summer. As it stands, the firms on average lost about 20 percent during the quarter - with Bear Stearns leading them with a 31 percent decline.""They are terribly, terribly important,"" said Quincy Krosby, chief economist for the U.S. insurance and investment group The Hartford. ""I don't think you can have a truly sustainable rally unless the financials stabilize. For the retail investor, the earnings will give general guidance for where we are in unraveling the crisis.""Individual investors have been nervously watching their retirement accounts and stock portfolios tumble, as the financial industry began to shudder from the pressure of weakening investments and dwindling access to capital.There is widespread fear that banks are not only sitting on bad loans and wrong-way trades, but they might also derail already stalling takeover activity and a dearth in corporate debt financing. Accounting rules that let firms place a value on assets based solely on their best guess of the worth could muddy the waters further.Richard Bove, an analyst with Punk Ziegel who has been among the industry's toughest critics, said there was a likelihood the banks' auditors had met with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission about what must be divulged on their balance sheets. He points out that regulators would be ""willing to go the extra mile to keep them in reasonable shape,"" and that it might be some time before investors get more accurate information.""If history is any gauge, you'll have to wait for their quarterly filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission to find out what is really going on with these companies,"" Bove said. ""It's going to be tough to make judgments.""Quarterly reports filed to the SEC, also known as 10-Qs, must be submitted to the regulator within 45 days of the end of the quarter. These documents typically offer more detail than what is released in earnings reports.Lehman Brothers was set to report Tuesday, and analysts like Bove will be looking for how much troubled debt is on the firms' books. In August, Lehman shuttered most of its mortgage business.Morgan Stanley, which has very little exposure to subprime mortgages, is known as one of the most aggressive traders on the street. Its report, due Wednesday, will also be well followed.Goldman's report Thursday will be a barometer of the overall industry because it is the most diverse investment bank, and it might have used volatile market conditions to make shrewd trades. The firm acknowledged last month that its flagship hedge fund had suffered steep losses.Bear Stearns will also report Thursday, and Wall Street will be looking for how its vast fixed-income business performed during the past few months. Two Bear Stearns hedge funds collapsed into bankruptcy this summer after wrong-way bets on mortgage debt.Merrill Lynch, the world's largest brokerage, will report its results in October. However, the broker said Friday that it had recorded adjustments to the value of certain investments in the third quarter, acknowledging they lost value as the debt markets remain in seizure.But regardless of how this week's results pan out, Wall Street's big players might be thrown a lifeline. The U.S. Federal Reserve, which has been injecting cash into the banking system to help stabilize it, will meet Tuesday to ponder a much-anticipated interest rate cut.The full effects of interest rate cuts are not typically felt in the financial system for up to a year. However, should central bankers lower rates, it might infuse enough enthusiasm into the credit markets to provide an instant psychological boost for the banks.""People get worn out by the crisis itself,"" Krosby said."
28,"PARIS, Sept. 17 — The United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr., said Monday that turmoil in the world’s financial markets could continue for some time. But he cautioned against the hasty introduction of regulations that could stymie innovation and slow economic growth.Mr. Paulson, who met here with President Nicolas Sarkozy and France’s finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said financial turbulence in the wake of the credit crisis this summer “will be with us for a while,” particularly in markets linked to subprime mortgages.He also warned that imposing new regulations could be counterproductive at a time when the global economy remains robust.“The whole world and the U.S. have benefited from innovative financing techniques and innovation in terms of securitization and credit availability, and so we need to think this through carefully and don’t rush to judgment and overreact,” Mr. Paulson said. “We have to get the balance right.”After his trip to Paris, Mr. Paulson met with Alistair Darling, the British chancellor of the Exchequer, in London, where he declared that the healthy economies of the United States and Britain should give investors confidence in dealing with turbulent market conditions.Asked whether it was a lack of regulation that precipitated the current market situation, he said, “History says it’s very difficult for policy to keep up with innovation.”Mr. Paulson also appeared to endorse Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French candidate to become the next managing director of the International Monetary Fund. Mr. Paulson said he already saw eye-to-eye with Mr. Strauss-Kahn over the need to change the I.M.F. so that it could play a continuing role in the global financial system. “I am very positive on Dominique Strauss-Kahn,” Mr. Paulson said, adding that he was “a very strong candidate.”Mr. Paulson also said his visit to Paris was a sign of “a new, very positive era of American and French relations.” He praised President Sarkozy for undertaking regulatory changes aimed at creating jobs and increasing economic growth and said he was in frequent contact with Ms. Lagarde over economic questions.Ms. Lagarde, speaking later with reporters, said France and the United States were in complete agreement over the need to press China to do more to strengthen the value of its currency, the yuan.“I think there is a total convergence of views on the imbalance of the values, particularly on the undervaluation of the yuan compared with European values and compared with American values,” she said."
29,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Federal Reserve today lowered its benchmark interest rate by a half point, a forceful policy shift intended to limit the damage to the economy from the recent disorder in the housing and credit markets.While an interest rate cut was widely expected, there had been profound uncertainty about whether the Fed would choose a more cautious quarter-point reduction. But the bolder action and an accompanying statement, both approved by a unanimous vote of the central bank’s policy-setting committee, made it clear that the Fed had decided the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.“Developments in financial markets since the committee’s last regular meeting have increased the uncertainty surrounding the economic outlook,” the central bank said. Signaling that it might cut rates more if necessary in months ahead, it said it would “continue to assess” the economic outlook and “act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.”The decision, which reset the overnight lending rate between banks to 4.75 percent, was the Fed’s first rate cut in four years.Stocks immediately soared. The Dow Jones industrial average registered its biggest one-day gain in almost five years, closing at 13,739.39, up 335.97, or 2.5 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose nearly 3 percent.For consumers, the Fed’s move could mean lower borrowing costs on for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the past month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said today that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, to 5.25 percent — also a half-point cut.This was the Federal Reserve’s most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when it suddenly slashed rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting because of signs that the economy was slipping into a recession. The last half-point cut in the federal funds rate came in November 2002.Economists said that the Fed’s move today was similarly pre-emptive. “Monetary policy makers are worried about growth being seriously compromised and are prepared to take whatever prudent steps they can to avoid a deep slump,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for MFR.Some aspects of today’s Fed’s move could fuel inflation fears. Gold, a traditional investment safe haven in times of inflation, soared immediately after the Fed’s decision was announced. As United States interest rates became less attractive for investment, the value of the dollar against the euro touched a new low before recovering slightly, and oil prices continued to climb even further above $80 a barrel.In the stock market, financial stocks posted the biggest gains, reflecting the fact that banks now will face lower borrowing costs, which should help drive profits higher.“Shock therapy,” was the assessment of Ethan Harris, chief economist at Lehman Brothers.But Mr. Harris cautioned that the Fed stopped short of signaling a firm commitment to more rate reductions. While it dropped its previous statement that inflation was still the “predominant concern,” which would argue against using lower rates to stimulate the economy, the Fed said that “inflation risks remain” and that it would “monitor inflation developments carefully.”David Rosenberg, chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, said the Fed appeared deliberately ambiguous about its readiness to cut rates even further at its policy meetings in October and December.“The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “It’s not at all clear they think they have more to do.”As recently as six weeks ago, the central bank was still predicting “modest” growth for the economy and warning that inflation remained its “predominant concern.” As in 2001, the Fed’s move today came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. This time, the panic is in credit markets spooked by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that crashed, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.In the jargon of economists, the turmoil in both cases represented a sudden “repricing” of risk. Other signs have surfaced recently that the financial market upheaval may not be isolated. Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the first monthly loss of jobs in four years. Employers eliminated 4,000 positions in August, a factor that may have played a role in the Fed’s decision today.By today, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. Despite the seemingly narrow debate — whether to lower the overnight federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percent or by one-half of a percent — the uncertainty about this policy meeting was higher than any other in the past four years.The debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession later this year? If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risked a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risked stoking inflation.Economists said what appeared to push the Fed to cut rates by a half point were the dismal job market numbers from August.“I think that was a real eye-opener for them,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist for Maria Fiorini Ramirez, an economic consulting firm in New York. “The only ammunition the consumer has left is from the labor market. If income growth is compromised here because the labor market is weakening, then you’ve got a serious problem.”Peter E. Kretzmer, senior economist for Bank of America, said that by cutting rates a half point, Fed policy makers may have been hoping to draw the investors’ attention away from the central bank.“I think they kind of cleared the decks,” he said. “They said we’re going to be a little bold and remove at least one source of uncertainty. And that is the source that says ‘What is the Fed thinking, and when are they move again?’ Maybe they can take the market’s mind off the Fed for a little while.”Ben S. Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had made it clear over the past month that the Fed did not simply want to rescue Wall Street investors who made bad bets or real estate speculators who bought properties on the assumption that prices would keep skyrocketing.But Mr. Bernanke also pledged that the Fed would act if the dislocation in financial markets or the downturn in housing threatened to derail overall growth.Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures is accelerating. RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that foreclosure filings — from default notices and auction sales to bank repossessions — were 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.The Labor Department also reported today that producer prices fell by 1.4 percent in August — much more than expected — because of slumping energy prices. That was positive news on inflation, but analysts said it was unlikely to have much influence on the Fed because the ""core” measure excluding energy and food prices increased 0.2 percent, slightly more than expected.Except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is ambiguous. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.Instead of the United States’ being the world’s engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.For the last four years, the Federal Reserve has telegraphed its intentions months in advance as it pursued a gradualist approach of slow but steady adjustments in monetary policy. It advertised its intention to raise rates gradually many months before it actually did so in June 2004, and then raised rates in well-signaled increments at each policy meeting over the next two years.By contrast, Wall Street analysts were sharply divided as of early today about how much the Fed would cut rates and what it would say in its statement about the economic outlook.A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.But the evidence so far is inconclusive. In August, for the first time in four years, the Labor Department estimated that the number of jobs declined slightly. It also reduced its estimates of job growth in June and July, suggesting that the labor market weakened even before credit markets froze up in early August.But other indicators — on consumer spending, consumer confidence and export growth — point to a continuation of modest growth.Right or wrong, today’s decision will be a defining moment for Mr. Bernanke, the former economics scholar at Princeton who became Fed chairman in February 2006.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one in three or somewhat higher. Alan Greenspan, who preceded Mr. Bernanke as Fed chairman, puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.The Fed’s course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.The resulting credit crunch has now affected all but the safest home mortgages, and also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its “discount window,” a program originally created as an emergency source of overnight funds for banks in a cash squeeze.But by most accounts, the turmoil in credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared, and demand for all forms of “asset-backed commercial paper,” which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt, company receivables, remains very weak."
30,"LONDON, Sept. 17 — Terry Mays and his wife, both retirees, decided during the weekend that a promise by the Bank of England to provide emergency financing for Northern Rock, the troubled British mortgage lender that has most of their savings, was not enough to calm their nerves.The couple joined hundreds of other Northern Rock customers Monday as lines formed for a third day in front of branches where people waited to withdraw their savings.“I don’t think the bank will collapse — but we just don’t have the nerves,” Mr. Mays said, surrounded by a group of depositors who had traveled with him to the central London branch from a southern one after being told that the wait there would be at least six hours. “I took some financial advice over the weekend, and I’m taking the money out to get peace of mind. We’re relying on this money for our pension.”Panicky customers have withdrawn £2 billion ($4 billion), since the bank acknowledged Friday that it could no longer raise money because of the credit squeeze that has constrained global markets after a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States.So far, assurances from Northern Rock’s chief executive, Adam J. Applegarth, and the chancellor of the Exchequer, Alistair Darling, that deposits were securely backed by the Bank of England have failed to impress depositors.In a bid to shore up confidence, Mr. Darling announced on Monday that the government would guarantee all deposits in Northern Rock even if the bank should collapse and would extend similar guarantees to any other troubled financial institution that approached the government. No other bank or institution had yet approached the Bank of England, he added.Unlike other banks that have been bailed out because of direct exposure to subprime mortgages, Northern Rock was the first to fall victim directly to the global credit squeeze, because it relied heavily on raising money in the capital markets.Shares in Northern Rock slumped 36 percent Monday, to a seven-year low, dragging European banking stocks lower across the board as jittery investors began scrutinizing banks to determine which ones might have a similar business model.Alliance & Leicester and Bradford & Bingley, two Northern Rock rivals that also tap the capital markets, fell 31 percent and 15 percent respectively. Large financial institutions, including HSBC Holdings, Société Générale of France and Deutsche Bank of Germany also declined, leading a 1.5 percent drop of the European Dow Jones Stoxx 600 index. The FTSE 100 in Britain fell 1.7 percent, and the CAC 40 in France fell 1.8 percent.The overnight rate that British banks charge to lend pounds to one another soared 60 basis points on Monday, to 6.47 percent, the highest level in more than a month, according to the British Bankers’ Association.Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Merrill Lynch cut their earnings estimates for several European banks Monday, including Northern Rock. Credit Suisse and Merrill said the bank was likely to be bought.“We think the game is over for Northern Rock in its present form,” a Merrill analyst, John-Paul Crutchley, wrote in a note to investors.The sight of hundreds of Britons lining up to make withdrawals after the unexpected and speedy decline of Northern Rock has also prompted questions about whether the robust British economy — supported in large part by a heated housing market — would suffer in the aftermath of the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States. The pound fell below $2 for the first time in nearly three weeks.Some economists said that the Northern Rock experience could dent consumer confidence and eventually have an effect on British economic growth.Members of Britain’s opposition Conservative Party said Monday that Prime Minister Gordon Brown had ignored warnings of a “looming debt crisis” for the last four years when he was chancellor of the Exchequer and that he had encouraged consumers to take on record debt.In recent years, British mortgage lenders began offering loans exceeding the value of the properties on which they were based. The easy availability of credit helped prop up property prices and fueled speculation in the real estate market.Mervyn A. King, the head of the Bank of England, also came under pressure to explain why the bank bailed out Northern Rock only days after refusing to inject liquidity into financial markets on the ground that such action encouraged “excessive risk-taking.”Northern Rock opened at 8 a.m. Monday, one hour earlier than usual, to deal with the expected wave of withdrawals. It had to increase the bandwidth on its Web site, which had struggled with the volume of people trying to get access.Patricia Carlton, a retiree who joined the line at noon Monday at a Northern Rock branch in London, said she decided to withdraw her money after watching the morning news and seeing lines forming at the bank branches.“I hate to take out the money, but I just don’t want to risk anything,” she said, adding that she did not yet know what she would do with it."
31,"When one of the world's big economies stumbles into a quagmire, as the United States has with the subprime mortgage crisis, investors and borrowers always start asking how they got into such a mess - and how they will get out. These days, the effects of globalization provide a partial answer for both questions.Globalization has added risks to the world's financial markets, but it has also created connections between economies that may add stability when one of them feels a jolt. In the future, financial regulation may even help to reduce those risks while preserving the benefits of interconnectedness.In the case of the current crisis, the idea came first: bundle high-risk mortgages in a way that made them more liquid and preserved their high returns. It caught on quickly. Low interest rates and the unification of the world's credit markets had made credit easily obtainable, and financial globalization meant that investors everywhere could pour their money into the same kind of asset.""There's been a lot of money sloshing around the markets looking for a place to be parked, not only because of the Fed but also because of what's been happening in the rest of the world,"" said Barry Eichengreen, a professor of economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley. ""It fed the securitization of mortgages and all kinds of other liabilities.""Yet during this period, as investors and banks in the United States, Europe and other regions bought up the complex new securities, some people who were ill-equipped to judge the risks got involved, often assuming that the rating agencies' assessments were enough.In addition, it became more difficult to figure out where, in the global credit market, the risks really lay. ""It's become more delocalized,"" said Raghuram Rajan, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago. ""You don't borrow from your neighborhood bank anymore, you don't deposit in your neighborhood bank. You invest more widely, and you invest through a whole group of intermediaries.""Furthermore, Rajan said, a herd mentality that might have been confined to one country market before can now spread around the world, magnifying the risks of a sudden shock.""When we all get into the same kinds of assets or the same kinds of trades at the same time because they've been lucrative, we all fall down at the same time,"" he said. ""In fact, there may be some incentive to all fall down at the same time, because then none of us takes the blame.""In the aftermath of a crisis, however, the interdependence of the world's economies can help to alleviate some of its worst effects.For example, Eichengreen said, an economic downturn in the United States could be mitigated by the relatively strong growth in Europe and Latin America. ""They are still going to be a sponge for our exports,"" he said. ""That's going to be an important stabilizing force for us.""Still, the rest of the world is likely to suffer if the situation in the United States gets much worse. ""The fact that so many economies are still dependent on U.S. demand, and haven't grown their own domestic demand, will cause some problems,"" Rajan said.Even China's strong growth may not provide enough support to stop a global slowdown. ""I don't believe that China has become a growth pole independent of the United States,"" said Eichengreen. ""If we go into a recession, their growth is certain to slow as well.""That might not be so bad for China, where worries about inflation and overheating continue to deepen, but few other places would welcome that sort of drag on their growth. So what can be done to deal with the problem of a risk wildfire before it starts?Rajan said old-fashioned due diligence, like getting banks to monitor the activities of the funds that borrow their money, could help. He also suggested changes in incentives for investment managers: ""What you can do is ensure that there are voluntary agreements that the incentive structures will have elements that are long term. If I've got 20 percent of my wealth riding in the fund that I manage, then I'm a little reluctant to do the carry trade for too long. It could close up.""But Eichengreen said the risks to the financial system justified regulation, and on a global scale.""We have the institutions for the coordination,"" he said. ""We have the Basel committee of bank supervisors. We have the International Organization of Securities Commissions. We need to push them to act more aggressively and more forcefully, and put a little less faith in the ability of the markets to solve their own problems."""
32,"NEW YORK —The U.S. mortgage lending crisis deepened Tuesday, as Impac Mortgage Holdings said it would quit most lending activities, while Accredited Home Lenders Holding posted a big quarterly loss and said its survival remained in doubt.The announcements came a day after another struggling lender, NovaStar Financial, gave up its real estate investment trust status sooner than expected because it could not pay a $157 million dividend to keep it.Dozens of mortgage lenders have quit the industry this year, including many that have gone bankrupt, amid rising defaults, falling home prices and investor resistance to buy home loans they now consider too risky.Impac said it will stop making ""Alt-A"" home loans, its main business, citing ""market disruptions and illiquidity."" Such loans often go to people who cannot document income or assets.The company, based in Irvine, California, also said it was quitting warehouse and commercial lending, and had fired 144 workers. It did not expect to pay its 10 cents per share common stock dividend for at least the rest of the year.""Given the severe dislocation of the marketplace, which included unprecedented margin calls, we are left with no other alternative but to downsize our company to better operate and navigate through this difficult and unrelenting environment,"" said Joseph Tomkinson, chief executive of Impac. He called the credit crisis the worst in his 25 years in the industry.Accredited, which makes subprime loans to people with weaker credit, posted a $260.2 million loss for the quarter ended March 31, according to a delayed report filed with securities regulators. That compared with a profit of $35.8 million a year earlier.Accredited, based in San Diego, said results suffered from a large loss from the sale of mortgage loans.It also said it expected to need further amendments to or waivers of covenants in its credit facilities in 2007. ""We cannot assure you that we will continue to operate as a going concern,"" the company said in its quarterly report.Accredited closed much of its lending operations this month, eliminating 1,600 of 2,600 jobs. It is suing to force Lone Star Funds, a private equity firm, to complete a $15.10 per share takeover. Accredited has rejected a lowered $8.50 per share offer from the Dallas-based firm that valued the company at $214 million."
33,"WASHINGTON —The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by a half point Tuesday, a forceful policy shift intended to limit the damage to the economy from the recent disorder in the U.S. housing and credit markets.While an interest-rate cut was widely expected, it had been uncertain whether the Fed would opt for a half-point or a quarter-point reduction.The Fed reduced the federal funds rate - the interest that banks charge each other for overnight loans - from 5.25 percent to 4.75 percent. It also reduced the discount rate - the direct loans it makes to banks - from 5.75 percent to 5.25 percent.In its statement, the Fed said it would continue to monitor the effects of the market upheaval and would act as needed.Many on Wall Street had been clamoring for weeks for a half-point cut, and the Fed's announcement Tuesday buoyed investors.Stocks immediately soared. The Dow Jones industrial average had been up about 75 points shortly before the announcement at 2:15 p.m., and within minutes it was up more than 200 points for the day. It closed up almost 336 points at 13,739.39.At 4 p.m., the euro rose to $1.3970, after briefly reaching a record $1.3981.For consumers, the Fed's move could mean lower borrowing costs on major loans like mortgages, home equity credit lines and auto loans.This was the Federal Reserve's first rate cut in four years, and its most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when it suddenly slashed rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting because of signs that the economy was slipping into a recession.As recently as six weeks ago, the central bank was still predicting ""modest"" growth for the economy and warning that inflation remained its ""predominant concern."" As in 2001, the Fed's move Tuesday came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. This time, the panic is in credit markets spooked by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that crashed, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.In the jargon of economists, the turmoil in both cases represented a sudden ""repricing"" of risk.By Tuesday, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. Despite the seemingly narrow debate - whether to lower the overnight federal funds rate by one-quarter of a percent or by one-half of a percent - the uncertainty about this policy meeting was higher than any other in the past four years.The debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: What were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession later this year? If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risked a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risked stoking inflation.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, had made it clear over the past month that the Fed did not simply want to rescue Wall Street investors who had made bad bets or real estate speculators who had purchased properties on the assumption that prices would keep skyrocketing.But Bernanke also pledged that the Fed would act if the dislocation in financial markets or the downturn in housing threatened to derail overall growth.Just hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating. RealtyTrac of Irvine, California, reported that foreclosure filings - from default notices and auction sales to bank repossessions - were 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.The Labor Department also reported Tuesday that producer prices fell by 1.4 percent in August - much more than expected - because of slumping energy prices.

34,"FRANKFURT —As central banks lower the cost of money to steady global financial markets amid the U.S. subprime crisis, critics are increasingly asking whether their actions are instead indulging financiers who engaged in reckless behavior.In economists' lingo, ""moral hazard"" is the danger that central banks, by providing cash in a pinch, are encouraging speculators to begin planting the seeds of the next crisis, and offering them a safety net not available to the average consumer.The question of moral hazard - which has been swirling since the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and other central banks injected billions in cash into credit markets last month - took on more relevance when the Bank of England and the Fed moved further to grease the wheels of lending Tuesday.The Bank of England last week criticized infusions of cash as de facto bailouts for investors who made bad decisions.But it found itself forced into a similar position Tuesday, announcing that it would provide $8.8 billion of ""exceptional"" funds after banks, frightened by the crisis at the mortgage lender Northern Rock, raised lending rates for one another.According to economists, central banks might on balance be creating a ""moral hazard"" effect now with liquidity infusions. But they are keen to avoid doing so over a longer period.Christian Noyer, governor of the Banque de France and a member of the ECB's interest rate-setting council for the 13-country euro area, defended the use of these tools during times of crisis.""Put very simply, financial turbulence and uncertainty have suddenly triggered an upward shift in the demand for central bank money,"" Noyer wrote in The Financial Times on Tuesday.""Standard economic theory,"" Noyer added, dictates that only central banks can restart flows of money that have been interrupted by a market crisis.Noyer argued that since this abnormal situation is ""unrelated to the state of the real economy,"" a liquidity infusion is justified.Thomas Mayer, chief Europe economist for Deutsche Bank, uses the metaphor of the central banks as plumbers, rather than lenders helping out banks, to justify their actions.""We had a serious plumbing problem in the credit markets,"" Mayer said. ""When the credit plumbing is blocked, you have to unblock it. That's your job.""The opposing view holds that the mere act of providing cash at the central banks' normal interest rates sends the wrong message.""I can only conclude that the Bank of England is a paper tiger,"" Willem Buiter, a professor at the London School of Economics, has written. ""It talks the 'no bailout' talk, but does not walk the talk.""Buiter has directed a steady stream of fire at central banks since the crisis began, arguing that the only justifiable liquidity infusion should come at a ""penalty rate"" above what the central bank normally charges.For a time, the Bank of England took that approach, but it reversed course Tuesday.Only time can tell whether central banks will offer enduring assistance to investors by knocking down interest rates over an extended period. But the current evidence suggests they are trying to avoid the mistakes of the past."
35,"NEW YORK —Lehman Brothers, the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States, said Tuesday that third-quarter profit fell less than expected, as strength in stock trading and investment banking offset losses from the struggling mortgage market.The report provided investors a crucial first glimpse at how Wall Street fared in the fallout from the mortgage crisis, which started when borrowers with poor credit began defaulting at a sharply higher rate earlier this year.The New York-based investment bank - the first of four to report results this week - said quarterly profit fell 3.2 percent to $887 million, or $1.54 per share, from $916 million, or $1.57 per share, a year earlier.Shares rose $1.61, or 2.7 percent, to $60.23 in premarket electronic trading. Other investment banks were higher as well.Lehman said revenue fell by $700 million because of ""substantial valuation reductions"" in mortgage-backed bonds and other investments. However, stronger investment banking and retail brokerage fees helped lift total revenue to $4.31 billion from $4.18 billion last year.The results topped Wall Street projections for a profit of $1.47 per share on $4.23 billion of revenue, according to analysts polled by Thomson Financial. However, analysts lowered their earnings expectations by about 16 percent over the last month, as Wall Street remained uncertain about exactly how much exposure Lehman had to decaying credit and mortgage markets.""Despite challenging conditions in the markets, our results once again demonstrate the diversity and financial strength of the Lehman Brothers franchise, as well as our ability to perform across cycles,"" Richard Fuld, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.Fuld, who has led Lehman Brothers since the bank was spun off from American Express in 1994, has tried to transform the company from a bond house into a full-service investment bank. The company has also made a big push overseas, which accounted for 53 percent of total revenue during the third quarter.The U.S. credit markets descended into distress this summer, dragged by a mortgage industry suffering from decaying credit quality.The mortgage meltdown has had ripple effects through Wall Street, pinching demand for some of the investment banks' best-selling products. Mortgage-backed bonds, collateralized debt obligations and asset-backed commercial paper are all much tougher to sell now.Lehman Brothers undertook major cutbacks in its mortgage business this year, shuttering its subprime mortgage lending arm, BNC Mortgage.

It advertised its intention to raise rates gradually many months before it actually did so in June 2004, and then raised rates in well-signaled increments at each policy meeting over the next two years.By contrast, Wall Street analysts were sharply divided as of early today about how much the Fed would cut rates and what it would say in its statement about the economic outlook.A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.But the evidence so far is inconclusive. In August, for the first time in four years, the Labor Department estimated that the number of jobs declined slightly. It also reduced its estimates of job growth in June and July, suggesting that the labor market weakened even before credit markets froze up in early August.But other indicators - on consumer spending, consumer confidence and export growth - point to a continuation of modest growth.Right or wrong, today's decision will be a defining moment for Bernanke, the former economics scholar at Princeton who became Fed chairman in February 2006.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one in three or somewhat higher. Alan Greenspan, who preceded Bernanke as Fed chairman, puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.The Fed's course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.The resulting credit crunch has now affected all but the safest home mortgages, and also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its ""discount window,"" a program originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze.But by most accounts, the turmoil in credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared, and demand for all forms of ""asset-backed commercial paper,"" which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt, company receivables, remains very weak."

42,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 18 — The Federal Reserve rolled out its most powerful interest rate weapon on Tuesday in a bid to stop the turmoil in housing and financial markets from bringing down the overall economy.But even as stock markets soared in a thunderous rally, the Fed carefully stopped short of implying any commitment to reduce rates even more in the months ahead. Indeed, policy makers cautioned that they still have lingering worries about inflation — a concern that would weigh against stimulating the economy further with cheaper money.In reducing its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large one-half percentage point, to 4.75 percent from 5.25 percent, the central bank made it clear that policy makers viewed the turbulence and disruptions of the past couple of months as too dangerous to ignore.The reaction in stock markets was ecstatic: the Dow Jones industrial average jumped 200 points almost instantly and ended the day up 335 points, or 2.51 percent, at 13,739.39.The move was the Fed’s first rate reduction of any kind in four years, the steepest in nearly five years and its most abrupt reversal of course since January 2001, when policy makers sharply cut rates at an unscheduled emergency meeting just before the last recession.“Shock therapy,” summed up Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Lehman Brothers.For consumers, the Fed’s move could mean lower borrowing costs for mortgages and automobile loans. But the impact may be muted, because investors remain deeply anxious about the credit quality of mortgages and other long-term loans. The main problem in the last month has not been high rates so much as the availability of capital to complete deals.Analysts described the Fed’s action as a bold attempt to restore confidence, with a quieter caveat that investors and consumers should not assume the certainty of more painkillers later this year.“The important policy debate now centers on the future interest rate path, but Fed officials left that more ambiguous,” said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley.Indeed, while many on Wall Street have been clamoring for an aggressive rate cut, some economists had warned against it, saying that it might send the wrong signal by bailing out those who contributed to the housing bubble and encourage future market excesses.In both the bold stroke and the fine print, the Fed’s move offered a revealing hint about Ben. S. Bernanke, the former professor from Princeton who took over as Fed chairman last year.Mr. Bernanke, a champion of steady rules to guide monetary policy, has long been seen as more skeptical about reacting to financial turbulence than his predecessor, Alan Greenspan.Mr. Bernanke, for example, made it clear that he did not want to rescue investors or real estate speculators who made bad decisions. But in shielding the economy from a downturn, the Fed will inevitably be helping some of the very people Mr. Bernanke did not want to help.What seems to have driven Mr. Bernanke to act more boldly, analysts said, was the jolt from the Labor Department’s unexpectedly poor employment report for August, which showed that the nation had lost jobs for the first time in four years.Still, Mr. Bernanke’s move was nothing if not a Greenspanian display of “discretionary” policy in response to trouble but before the signs of an economic downturn were unambiguous. And in doing so, he obtained unanimous agreement from other board members, even though some Fed officials have been dubious about the need for a rescue.The Fed’s course change has been under way since early August, when fears about huge losses on subprime mortgage loans and a continued downturn in housing caused a much broader panic in credit markets.The resulting credit tightness has now affected all but the safest home mortgages and has also greatly reduced the ability of private equity funds and hedge funds to borrow money at low rates. Many banks, which had been planning to resell their loans into the giant market for tradable commercial debt securities, are now being forced to absorb loans that the securities markets will no longer take.In the rate cut and an accompanying statement, the central bank acknowledged that the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.“The tightening of credit conditions has the potential to intensify the housing correction and restrain economic growth more generally,” the Fed’s policy-making committee said in its statement. “Today’s action is intended to forestall some of the adverse effects on the broader economy that might otherwise arise from the disruptions in financial markets.”Leaving the door open for the possibility of additional rate cuts, the central bank said it would “continue to assess” the economic outlook and “act as needed to foster price stability and sustainable economic growth.”But while Fed policy makers abandoned previous statements that the risk of inflation was their “predominant concern,” they did not say that the risk of a downturn had replaced inflation as their main worry. Rather, they spoke of “uncertainty” and left it at that.“The Fed kept its cards much closer to its vest than anyone would have guessed,” said David Rosenberg, chief North American economist for Merrill Lynch. “It’s not at all clear they think they have more to do.”Trading among investors indicated that Wall Street expects the central bank to keep cutting rates. Many analysts contend that it needs to cut twice as deeply as it has so far by early next year.And in a sign that the politics of rate-cutting could become more bruising, at least one prominent Democrat quickly criticized the Fed’s cautionary warning about inflation at a time of slowing growth. Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said he was “surprised” by the Fed’s statement.“I hope, in this instance, that markets and consumers will pay more attention to what the F.O.M.C. did than to what it said,” Mr. Frank added, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.In a separate move to bolster the banking system, the Fed also said that it had cut its discount lending rate, which applies to short-term emergency loans to banks, by a half a percentage point, to 5.25 percent.As in 2001, the Fed’s move came after a panic in financial markets and the collapse of a speculative bubble. Today, the panic is in credit markets unnerved by dubious mortgages on inflated housing prices. Back then, it was the stock market that was in trouble, initially because the air went out of inflated dot-com stocks.But the debate within the Fed was all about risk probabilities: what were the odds that the twin meltdowns in housing and mortgage markets would tip the overall economy into a recession?If policy makers cut rates too cautiously, they risk a recession; if they cut them too much or too early, they risk stoking inflation.Ever since the jobs data was released this month, it seemed clear that Fed policy makers were no longer debating whether to reduce rates but how much to lower them. A smaller rate reduction posed a risk of moving too slowly if the economy was indeed in danger of stalling. But a bigger rate reduction could have been taken as a sign of Fed panic, and it added to the risk of stoking inflationary pressures that the central bank had just begun to tamp down.Just a few hours before the central bank announced its decision, new statistics indicated that the pace of home foreclosures was accelerating.RealtyTrac of Irvine, Calif., reported that the number of foreclosure filings — from default notices and auction sale notices to bank repossessions — was 36 percent higher in August than in July and 115 percent higher than one year ago.But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the real economy is indecisive. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.Instead of the United States being the world’s engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one-in-three or somewhat higher. Mr. Greenspan puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.On Aug. 17, the Federal Reserve moved to ease the liquidity crisis by encouraging banks to borrow money through its discount window, an outlet originally created as an emergency source of overnight funding for banks in a cash squeeze.But by most accounts, the turmoil in the credit markets has abated very little. The market for subprime mortgages has all but disappeared and demand for all forms of asset-backed commercial paper — which are securities backed by mortgages, credit card debt and company receivables — remains very weak."
43,"IN recent years, LendingTree, the mortgage Web site operator, prospered with upbeat advertising that confidently told potential homeowners, “When banks compete, you win.”But last week, that campaign vanished, replaced with sober, straightforward ads that seek to educate consumers about “smart borrowing.”LendingTree is not the only financial marketer abruptly shifting gears. Weeks after problems with subprime mortgages began roiling the industry, advertisers are offering reassurances about their stability and ability to ride out the storm, whether a short-term dislocation or a serious threat.“Whether you are saving money, looking for a loan or managing a business, you can always depend on Chase,” assert ads for the JPMorgan Chase Bank unit of JPMorgan Chase & Company.Ads for New York Life promote what a “commitment to our policy holders and their peace of mind” while repeating the words “financial strength” four times — including the first two words of the headlines.Astoria Federal Savings ads promote its longevity, being in business for “more than 118 years,” and use soothing phrases like “We’re part of your community, and we’re here when you need us.”The changes are reminiscent of the makeovers that financial marketers have given their ads during previous tumultuous times, like the stock market crash of 1987, the East Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the dot-com bust.Other financial advertisers, however, are taking a contrary point of view when it comes to today’s turmoil, saying they see no need for such measures — or even deeming them counterproductive.“Most market research we’ve done shows that when a stock market says, ‘Don’t worry,’ people worry,” said John L. Jacobs, executive vice president and chief marketing officer at the Nasdaq Stock Market. “We tend to be agnostic to a market condition because we’re here for the long term, the big picture,” he added.So a television campaign for Nasdaq that began this week, created by the McKinney & Silver division of Havas, is focused on the achievements of companies like eBay and Starbucks, which are listed on Nasdaq. The humorous commercials carry an optimistic theme, asserting that a company trading on Nasdaq “moves life forward.”In recent weeks, however, it seemed to many investors and homeowners that life might be moving in the other direction. The reason was the turmoil in the mortgage markets and the resulting gyrations in share values on the stock exchanges.•The campaign from LendingTree, which started last Thursday, characterizes conditions as “chaotic.”The campaign, by an internal team at LendingTree and Mullen, an agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, extends from print and television to the company’s Web site (lendingtree.com) and YouTube. The ads take an educational tack, centered on what are described as “Five steps for smart borrowing.”One of those steps is a measure that most marketers rarely take: damping consumer interest.“Make sure you can afford it,” Step 4 cautions, referring to a mortgage loan. “The costs of owning a home extend far beyond the mortgage payment.”The goal is to communicate to consumers that LendingTree realizes “the landscape for lending has changed considerably,” said C. D. Davies, chief executive at LendingTree, part of IAC/InterActiveCorp.LendingTree added a feature to its Web site in 2004 called the Smart Borrower Center, Mr. Davies said, and made it the subject of ads that ran in some magazines as recently as July. But it was not until last week that LendingTree switched gears to the five steps approach from its far more upbeat “When banks compete, you win” campaign.“If I had to do it over again, I would’ve maybe started it 15 to 30 days earlier,” Mr. Davies said of the switch.But with “all the people who need to buy homes, who need to be lent money, who may have adjustable-rate mortgages that are adjusting” in the coming months, he added, “it’s not too late” to revise marketing tactics.The campaign for Chase Bank, created by McGarry Bowen, began appearing in late August in local and national newspapers. Some ads carry headlines like “Strength. Value. Commitment. Qualities you’ve come to depend on.” Some offer promotional rates on certificates of deposit or home equity loans. And other ads promise that Chase Bank is “committed to helping you buy or refinance your home.”The “volatility in the lending market, in the stock market,” inspired the campaign, said Ryan McInerney, head of marketing for consumer banking at JPMorgan Chase.“We stepped back and said, ‘This is a big time of uncertainty,’ ” he added. “We saw it as an opportunity to grow our business while reassuring customers.”By contrast, the New York Life Insurance Company was reluctant to attribute the timing of its campaign to market conditions.Rather, said John Brine, a vice president at New York Life, the genesis of the ads was a recent upgrading of its insurance financial-strength rating by Standard & Poor’s, which gives the company “the highest rating from all four major rating agencies” (the others being A. M. Best, Fitch and Moody’s).“The upgrade, based on our financial strength and industry leadership, speaks volumes about the quality of New York Life,” Mr. Brine wrote in an e-mail message, “particularly in this volatile environment.” The ads are from Berlin Cameron United, part of the United division of the WPP Group.•Experts in brand marketing, corporate-identity consulting and crisis management offered divergent opinions on the timing and appropriateness of the campaigns.“Obtuse and reactive and dilatory,” Dean Crutchfield, senior vice president for marketing at Wolff Olins, a division of the Omnicom Group, said about many of them. “They’re groveling.”Worse yet, Mr. Crutchfield said, the ads are “self-indulgent” because they are “talking about the companies, not about the consumer.”By comparison, Eric Dezenhall, chief executive at Dezenhall Resources, said the campaigns might be arriving at the right time.“There is a certain danger in coming out too fast,” Mr. Dezenhall said, “because you don’t know if you’re dealing with a couple of bad days or a fundamental sea change.”As current conditions suggest there are chronic aspects to the problems, he added, advertisers like LendingTree are clever to adopt an educational subtext for their ads.“Sometimes in crisis situations, the best you can do is give anxious people a sense of control and a sense of choice instead of curing their anxiety,” Mr. Dezenhall said. “This isn’t marketing to increase the upside; it’s communication to limit the downside.”Don Peppers, a founding partner at the Peppers & Rogers Group, said he believed that the primary issues for financial marketers in addressing consumers who feel victimized were trust and competence.“The more self-interested you are, the less I’m willing to trust you,” said Mr. Peppers, whose consultancy is part of the Carlson Marketing unit of the Carlson Companies. “And do you have the competence to deliver on the promises you’re making me?”Too many financial marketers adopted business models “that maximized the short term at whatever cost,” Mr. Peppers said. “Getting their credibility back is going to hinge more on the actions they take than the advertising they produce.”"
44,"Prices at the producer level declined in August, the government reported yesterday, signaling a possible slackening of inflation pressures in the months ahead.Rapidly falling energy costs, including a 13.8 percent plunge in gasoline prices, led to a 1.4 percent drop in the Producer Price Index in August after a 0.6 percent rise in July. But the more crucial core rate of inflation, which excludes food and energy, was up 0.2 percent, a slight acceleration from July, driven by increased costs for vehicles and prescription drugs.“There are other indications in the goods sector that there are some significant price pressures,” said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs. “So you want to put it in perspective, but it’s definitely a piece of good news.”While a recent rebound in oil prices could lead to higher fuel costs in the weeks ahead, other inflation pressures appear to be easing. Analysts pointed to a half-point decline in the cost of goods used to make other goods, known as intermediate goods, as a sign that price increases were slowing further up the production chain and that consumers may see some relief as those goods are processed and enter the retail market.“The intermediate-materials pattern offers a hint of evidence that inflation pressures at the consumer price level will be weakening,” said Kenneth Beauchemin, United States economist for Global Insight, an economic research firm in Lexington, Mass.The new inflation figures were released ahead of the Federal Reserve’s announcement yesterday afternoon cutting its benchmark interest rate by an unexpectedly large half a percentage point, a move that was warmly greeted by Wall Street investors dealing with a credit squeeze caused by this summer’s subprime mortgage crisis.The slowdown in producer prices  what businesses charge one another for materials and goods used along the way in the production process  suggested some leeway for the Fed to move ahead with its expected cut, though several economists said the report had little impact on yesterday’s meeting.“This will carry mostly zero weight,” said Mickey Levy, the chief economist at Bank of America. “It’s just obvious that the Fed’s focus is not on near-term inflation conditions.”The report on consumer prices  a more closely watched and less volatile inflation gauge  will be released today.Prices of intermediate goods like steel, cement and industrial chemicals fell 1.2 percent last month. And prices of crude goods, which include raw goods like scrap metal and animals for slaughter, dropped 3 percent.The drop in energy costs was the largest factor pushing prices down in August. The price of gasoline fell 13.8 percent; natural gas 8.5 percent; and home heating oil 6 percent. Energy prices, however, have been rather erratic in recent months. The price of a barrel of oil has been posting record highs above $80 in recent days.Food prices declined 0.2 percent. But eggs, fresh fruits and vegetables fell by much larger amounts.Capital equipment prices  for items like agricultural machinery, heavy-duty vehicles and office furniture  were essentially flat.Mr. Levy said that nothing about yesterday’s report was “really out of whack,” noting that trends in productivity, wages and unit labor costs offset any rises in inflation for core wholesale goods over the last year.But with the Federal Reserve announcement dominating the talk on Wall Street yesterday, the producer price report quickly became old news.“It’s taking the back seat to the Fed’s more pressing issues,” Mr. Levy said."
45,"HONG KONG, Sept. 19 — Asian stock markets rose sharply today and European markets were off to a strong start this morning following a powerful rise in the American markets Tuesday after the Federal Reserve announced a surprisingly large half a percentage point cut in interest rates.And U.S. stocks looked poised today to add to the previous session’s rally, the biggest in four years.Leading Asian share indexes were pushed to their highest levels in more than a month, with the Hang Seng Index in Hong Kong rising 4 per cent to a record close of 25,554.64.In Europe, the FTSE 100 gained 2 per cent to 6,404.4 in morning trading, while the Xetra Dax rose 1.7 per cent to 7,705.34 and the CAC-40 added 1.9 per cent to 5,656.19. Commodity stocks also surged, thanks to higher metal and oil prices.Particularly strong were banking shares, which were recently battered on worries about their exposure to a crisis in the U.S. subprime or risky mortgages market. Shares in British home builders rose sharply as well, with Persimmon up 5.7 percent and Barratt Developments gaining 5.4 percent.In Asia, the rate cut is seen as particularly benefiting exporters of cars and electronic goods that rely heavily on the United States market. Toyota Motor Corporation had its biggest gain in more than three years on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, adding 4.9 percent.In Seoul, Samsung Electronics and Hyundai Motor Company, both heavily reliant on the U.S. market were up 1.9 per cent and 4.6 percent respectively, leading a surge in the share prices for exporters.But the enthusiasm to cash in the American rate cut was tempered by a discomforting message implicit in the decision to drop the benchmark interest rate to 4.75 percent.“I don’t think anyone can feel comfortable that all is well,” said Edmund Harriss, the investment director with Guinness Atkinson Investment Managers, which has $370 million in assets in three Asia-focused funds. On one hand, the move signifies that the Fed is “prepared to act as needed,” Mr. Harriss said, but on the other, the United States economy may be “looking weaker than we thought.”Whether the old adage about the U.S. economy sneezing and the rest of the world catching a cold holds true is a question on the minds of many economists and business executives in Asia as they watch the fallout from the crisis in the U.S. over defaults on home loans to poor grade borrowers, the so-called sub-prime mortgage problem.The aggressive rate cut by the Federal Reserve has signaled to many economists the depth of concern over a U.S. recession brought on by a credit squeeze and declining consumer consumption.But what impact will that have on Asia? Just two days before the Federal Reserve’s announcement, the Manila-based Asian Development Bank issued its annual economic outlook report for Asia, forecasting average growth in the region of 8.3 percent for 2007. This upgraded its earlier estimate of 7.6 percent. Growth for 2008 was forecast to be 8.2 percent.One of the bank’s key messages was that Asia is well placed to manage any U.S. slowdown, although the comment came with the caveat that the outlook for the region in 2008 is “hazy” because of uncertainty in global financial markets and the health of the world’s biggest economy.“Developing Asia’s defenses against external shocks are solid and it can weather a slowdown in the United States,” the bank said. “The region’s growth prospects will continue to depend on how well the countries address their internal challenges.”At a conference in Manila today, Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the bank, said the U.S . rate cut would help stabilize financial markets and give a timely boost to the U.S. economy.“It would definitely improve the prospect of sustained strong economic growth in the United States, which could be also very beneficial particularly for emerging economies in Asia,” Kuroda said. “So, I would say that the decision would be greatly appreciated by many economies, financial sectors in the region.”The bank’s outlook report pointed to research by the International Monetary Fund that growth in countries of developing Asia declined by 0.28 percent for every percentage point fall in U.S. growth in the five U.S. recessions from 1974 to 2001.Even oil priced at about $82 a barrel is yet to shake confidence in the region’s ability to maintain the fastest growth rates in the world, although it will increase the budget cost of direct and indirect subsidies for consumers.Big Asian manufacturers with significant exposure to the U.S. market will be hoping the rate cut will ease the effects of the sub-prime crisis in damping consumer consumption, hence the rally in stocks of car and electronics companies Wednesday. Markets were ebullient across the region.In late trading, the Morgan Stanley Capital International Asia-Pacific Index jumped 3.9 percent “It wasn’t a big topic of discussion for us today,” said Jake Jang, a spokesman for Hyndai Motor Co. “But we hope that the Fed’s rate decrease will help improve the consumer sentiment in the United States and help our car sales there.”Still, other analysts were less sanguine about the effect of the rate cut. Christopher Lingle, a research scholar at the Centre for Civil Society, a think tank in New Delhi, said the Federal Reserve had “decided to refill the punch bowl”, encouraging loose lending practices.“I think it’s a stupid idea, done by stupid people, to be polite,” said Lingle. “The Federal Reserve system has been engaged in one of the most ruinous monetary policies of the last century, starting with Alan Greenspan,” Lingle said.Before Tuesday’s rate cut “some of the excess liquidity was trying to dry up, bankers were realizing that the party should be over and getting out before the hangover started,” Lingle said.For Asia’s central banks there is sufficient uncertainty about the global economy that they are widely expected by economists to take a wait-and-see approach to any interest rate changes of their own.The Bank of Japan decided Wednesday to leave rates unchanged, despite favoring a policy of incremental increases. Other central banks, like the Bank of Korea, are also likely to be cautious about going ahead with forecast rate rises, say analysts.Toshihiko Fukui, the bank governor, said the decision to keep rates on hold was influenced by the downside risk for the U.S. economy and the potential impact on the state of the global economy, despite Japanese rates being low compared to the strength of the domestic economy.”‘Uncertainty over the world economy has grown,” Reuters reported him saying. “We will make an appropriate policy judgment looking at economic data and risk, both at home and abroad.”Mr. Harriss, the investment director with Guinness, said the rate cut might offer only a temporary reprieve. “Once the dust has settled, the concerns that have been there for a while still remain,” said Mr. Harriss."
46,"LONDON —The Bank of England on Wednesday abruptly reversed its policy of refusing to ease lending standards, offering to inject cash into British money markets amid criticism that it had not done enough to stem a credit crunch that has undercut one of Europe's largest economies.The action came a day after the U.S. Federal Reserve eased credit conditions with an aggressive half-point cut in interest rates, a move that buoyed global stock markets Wednesday but also fanned concern that the United States might still face a notable slowdown.Economists have been trimming their global and national growth forecasts as the global credit crunch, spawned by a meltdown in the market for U.S. subprime loans, curbs lending and menaces consumer confidence.In Britain, the crisis hit abruptly and unexpectedly when Northern Rock, a mortgage lender, ran into difficulties last week that threatened to destabilize the wider British banking system.Days earlier, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said the bank would not follow the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank by injecting cash into money markets where banks had stopped lending because of volatile conditions, saying such moves encouraged risky behavior by banks and sowed the seeds of future financial crises.The Federal Reserve said on Aug. 24 that it would accept asset-backed commercial paper as collateral in exchange for central bank loans and the European Central Bank has loaned billions in cash to banks in seven special auctions since Aug. 9.King was forced to change his tone after the credit crunch that hobbled Northern Rock showed signs of spreading more widely through the British banking system.Political criticism has been mounting that the Bank of England was too slow to react to the current credit squeeze, and that earlier reassurances could have soothed panicky customers who lined up for days to withdraw their savings from Northern Rock branches.It is ""a major about-turn from its previous position, partly due to the realization that the problem has just not gone away,"" said Jonathan Loynes, chief European economist at Capital Economics in London.""It appears he realized that rather than sit there in defiance it's better to actually do something that seems long overdue,"" said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas in London.King is scheduled to explain his policies to British lawmakers at a hearing in Parliament on Thursday.The central bank said it would provide funds at a three-month maturity and would accept ""mortgage collateral"" at an auction of £10 billion, or $20 billion, in loans next week in order to ""alleviate the strains in longer-maturity money markets."" The bank will still charge a penalty rate of 6.75 percent, it said.The bank will also make three further offerings at ""weekly intervals"" to reduce the gap between the benchmark rate of 5.75 percent and the rate banks charge to lend to each other. Banks have been reluctant to lend to one another because they preferred to hang on to their own money while it remains unclear how much longer the credit squeeze will last.The three-month London interbank rate, or Libor, dropped 0.2 percentage point to 6.55 percent on Wednesday. The overnight rate declined 0.25 percentage point to 5.89 percent.Some economists said that the latest cash injection might give the Bank of England more room to tackle the effects of the market turmoil without having to cut interest rates, something that King is trying to avoid.""Tackling the problems now directly reduces the pressure to do it through monetary policies,"" Loynes said. ""Looking at the economy as a whole, there's no real need to cut rates.""The bank has been raising rates as a red-hot housing market showed signs of topping out, and as consumers showed signs of taking on excess debt.Still, a number of analysts believe the Bank of England will have to cut rates next year. That, coupled with the announcement of the cash injection, led the pound to post its second-biggest decline in almost two months. The pound fell to $2.0027 in London from $2.0122 Tuesday.In the United States, the Fed left the door open to the possibility of additional rate cuts. Other countries are closely monitoring the health of the U.S. economy, amid concern that any difficulties in that economy are quickly felt elsewhere.But except for the housing downturn, which Fed officials admit is much more severe than they had expected, the evidence of a recession in the U.S. economy is unclear. Global economic growth is much stronger than in 2001, and American exports have climbed about 14 percent over the last year.Instead of the United States being the world's engine of growth, the global economy could now become the engine of American growth.Many Wall Street economists place the odds of a recession at about one in three or somewhat higher. Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, puts the odds at somewhat more than the one-in-three that he estimated earlier this year.Markets rallied across the board following the Fed's decision. Wall Street jumped higher for a second straight day, while in Europe, the FTSE 100 in Britain surged 2.8 percent, the DAX in Germany gained 2.3 percent and the CAC 40 in France jumped 3.3 percent. Leading share indexes throughout Asia surged to their highest levels in more than a month, Commodity stocks also surged thanks to higher metal and oil prices."
47,"WASHINGTON —Like the tides, the wave of good feelings that swept over Wall Street and Main Street U.S.A. with the Federal Reserve's big interest rate cut could ebb just as quickly.American homeowners opening up statements for their adjustable-rate mortgages come October will experience a jolt when the rates jump, but not as severe a jolt as it could have been.Wall Street's mood swings - reflecting bouts of panic and then some relief - are expected to linger.That is because the Fed's action, while perhaps providing some help, will not cure problems in the ailing housing market, which are still expected to drag well into next year.It will take time for builders to work off a glut of unsold homes. That means the housing slump will continue to hold back the economy and probably lead to more job cuts in construction, manufacturing and other industries.The Fed's action also will not prevent home foreclosures and late mortgage payments from rising in the months ahead.Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, and his colleagues, in a bold move on Tuesday, sliced a benchmark interest rate by one-half percentage point to 4.75 percent. It was the first rate cut in more than four years.Their aim is to prevent the U.S. economy from being thrown into a recession by a meltdown in housing prices and a credit crunch. Lower rates should induce people and businesses to increase spending and investing, which would help spur economic activity.Wall Street investors were cheered by the move, sending the Dow Jones industrial average zooming 335.97 points on Tuesday. It was the Dow's biggest one-day point jump in nearly five years.Some of the buoyancy carried over into Wednesday, with investors pushing up the Dow by around 80 points in midday trading.Over the short term, the rate cut can provide important psychological support. It could make investors, businesses and others less inclined to clamp down or make drastic changes in their behavior that would hurt the economy.""This does not heal the financial markets, but it can help in the process of healing. But we're not there yet,"" said Ken Mayland, economist at ClearView Economics.The improved mind set, though, could turn out to be fleeting.""I think the honeymoon is going to be pretty short for the euphoria of this Fed cut,"" said Greg McBride, senior financial analyst for Bankrate.com. ""A half-point cut can only do so much. It doesn't transform the housing market into sunshine and daffodils.""The housing market is suffering through its worst slump in 16 years. Home sales are expected to keep on sagging. Home prices, which saw double-digit gains in many areas during the boom, have cooled off significantly. Affordability is still an issue for would-be home buyers, experts say.Pain will continue to be felt by borrowers, lenders and investors of subprime mortgages - higher-risk loans made to people with spotty credit or with low incomes.Analysts estimate that 2 million adjustable-rate mortgages will jump from low initial teaser rates to higher rates this year and next. Steep prepayment penalties have made it difficult for some to get out of their mortgages. Some overstretched homeowners cannot afford to refinance or even sell their homes.The Fed's action does provide a bit of relief. For owners facing a reset on Oct. 1, their new rate will rise to 6.75 percent, versus 7.50 percent if it had reset a few months earlier, McBride said.""The payment is still going up by hundreds of dollars a month,"" he said. ""So people are not going to feel warm and fuzzy.""The subprime mortgage meltdown has forced some lenders out of business, and whacked investors.The U.S. Congress, meanwhile, is working on plans to help struggling homeowners avoid foreclosure, although it could take a few months for a final package to be approved.For consumers, whose confidence has been rattled by the housing and credit problems, much turns on whether employment conditions continue to deteriorate.The U.S. economy lost 4,000 jobs in August, the first decline in four years. The unemployment rate, now at 4.6 percent, is expected to climb close to 5 percent by the end of the year. A softening job market eventually will probably mean slower wage growth.Howard Chernick, an economics professor at Hunter College, said he did not think the Fed's rate cut would make people rush to the malls.""Consumer spending is influenced by employment and wages,"" Chernick said. ""Aside from the euphoria some might now feel, I don't think there is going to be a big effect.""It will take months for the Fed's rate cut to ripple through the economy, with the hope that it will bolster activity.Analysts expect the economy to slow to a rate of about 2 percent in the July-to-September quarter. That would be just half the pace of the previous three months. Growth in the final three months of this year could turn out to be even weaker.The former Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, in an interview Monday with The Associated Press, said the odds of a recession were growing.""Obviously the odds have moved up to more than a third, but I doubt if we are anywhere near 50 percent yet,"" he said.Earlier this year, his prediction of a one-in-three chance of a recession caused Wall Street to nosedive."
48,"A government regulator gave Fannie Mae permission yesterday to slightly increase the amount of mortgages it can buy for its investment portfolio, a move that analysts say will do little to ease the strain on the housing market.The regulator, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, said Fannie Mae could expand its loan portfolio by 2 percent a year, an adjustment to a cap it put in place last May after it exposed widespread accounting problems.Ofheo said it was also adjusting the method it used to determine the size of Fannie Mae’s mortgage portfolio, which will set the new cap at $735 million.The moves, along with similar ones for Freddie Mac, should give the nation’s two biggest mortgage buyers a bit more flexibility in managing their portfolios. The changes are also intended to encourage the companies to purchase as much as $20 billion each in subprime loans.But just two days ago, Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, in a letter to Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts said relaxing the portfolio restrictions on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could prove “ill advised.”Wall Street analysts said that Ofheo’s changes would do little to ease the pressures on the housing market. And Fannie Mae, which has lobbied to raise the portfolio limit by 10 percent, and several Democratic lawmakers said yesterday that the moves did not go far enough.In a statement, Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee and a Democratic candidate for president, called Ofheo’s decision “timid and inadequate.” He said the administration was ignoring the severity of the subprime mortgage crisis.Others, however, suggested it could be a way for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to start regaining Ofheo’s trust.“I actually think this was a smart way of giving the enterprises an opportunity to prove themselves,” said Josh Rosner, a managing director at Graham Fisher & Company who has been critical of Fannie Mae. Under the requirements, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac must provide more frequent and detailed financial disclosures, including a monthly report that should more clearly parse out their purchases of subprime loans.Ofheo’s announcement came as the Senate Banking Committee voted 20-to-1 to approve legislation raising a separate limit on home loans made through the Federal Housing Administration. That could help prospective home buyers in higher-cost areas like California and New York but do little to ease the bigger challenge faced by homeowners who may lose their homes if they fall further behind on their payments.If yesterday’s bill is passed by the full Senate, it would need to be reconciled with legislation passed in the House.It also came just two days after Mr. Bernanke sent a letter to Mr. Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, that defended the current portfolio limits and urged Congress to move cautiously if it considers letting Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac buy mortgages over the current $417,000 limit.In the letter, he suggested that allowing the companies to buy higher-priced mortgages would extend an “implied guarantee to another portion of the mortgage market.”“If the Congress is inclined to move in this direction, it should consider whether such action could be taken in a way that makes the change explicitly temporary as well as promptly implemented, lest it inhibit private securitization activity in the interim,” Mr. Bernanke wrote."
49,"LONDON, Sept. 19 — The Bank of England abruptly reversed its policy on Wednesday of refusing to ease lending standards, offering to inject cash into British money markets amid criticism that it had not done enough to stem a credit squeeze that has undercut its economy.The action came a day after the Federal Reserve eased credit conditions with an aggressive half-point cut in interest rates, a move that buoyed global stock markets but also fanned concern that the United States might still face a notable slowdown.Economists have been trimming their international and national growth forecasts as the global credit squeeze, spawned by a meltdown in the market for subprime loans in the United States, curbs lending and saps consumer confidence.In Britain, the crisis hit abruptly when Northern Rock, a mortgage lender, ran into difficulties last week that threatened to destabilize the wider British banking system.Days earlier, the Bank of England governor, Mervyn King, said the bank would not follow the Fed and the European Central Bank by injecting cash into a system where banks had stopped lending because of volatile conditions, saying such moves encouraged risky behavior by banks.The Fed said on Aug. 24 that it would accept asset-backed commercial paper as collateral in exchange for central bank loans, and the E.C.B. has lent billions in cash to banks in seven special auctions since Aug. 9.Mr. King was forced to change his stance after the credit squeeze that hobbled Northern Rock showed signs of spreading more widely through the British banking system.Political criticism has been mounting that the Bank of England was too slow to react and that earlier reassurances could have soothed panicky customers who lined up for days to withdraw their savings from Northern Rock branches.“It appears he realized that rather than sit there in defiance it’s better to actually do something that seems long overdue,” said Alan Clarke, an economist at BNP Paribas in London.Mr. King is scheduled to explain his policies to British lawmakers on Thursday at a hearing in Parliament. The central bank said it would provide funds at a three-month maturity and would accept “mortgage collateral” at an auction of £10 billion ($20 billion) in loans next week to “alleviate the strains in longer-maturity money markets.” The bank will still charge a penalty rate of 6.75 percent, it said.Some economists said that the latest cash injection might give the Bank of England more room to address the effects of the market turmoil without having to cut interest rates, something Mr. King is trying to avoid.The bank has been raising rates as a red-hot housing market showed signs of topping out, and as consumers showed signs of taking on excess debt.Still, a number of analysts believe the Bank of England will have to cut rates next year."
