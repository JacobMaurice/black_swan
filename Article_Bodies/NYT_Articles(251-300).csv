0,"PARIS —WestLB, the troubled German state-run bank, said Thursday that it had lost more than $820 million on speculative trades in global stock markets in the first half of 2007 - pushing it into a net loss for the period and renewing pressure on the lender to find a merger partner.The bank, which is based in Düsseldorf, swung to a net loss of €170 million, or $232 million for the six months to June 30, from a profit of €136 million a year earlier. Still, it said it did not expect to suffer any significant losses in the second half of the year from the ongoing crisis in the U.S. mortgage-backed securities market.""Our profit has been severely hit by the losses occurred in our proprietary trading,"" WestLB's chief executive, Alexander Stuhlmann, said in a statement.WestLB said the losses suffered by its own stock-trading desk amounted to a total of €604 million, but that these were partially offset by gains from trading in bonds and currencies - limiting the net trading loss to €309 million.""This is a setback for the bank and masks the fact that we have been successful on other areas of our business,"" Stuhlmann said.WestLB's stock traders lost money earlier this year by betting, wrongly, that price gaps between common and preferred shares of certain companies would narrow. The substantial bets involved shares in companies like Volkswagen, BMW and Metro. When it reported its first-quarter results in April, the bank said it had divested large parts of its trading portfolio and that losses on the soured trades amounted at that time to just €243 million.Stuhlmann's predecessor, Thomas Fischer, and the bank's chief risk officer, Matthijs van den Adel, were forced out in July amid an investigation by German financial regulators into WestLB's risky trading practices. Robert Stein, who had previously overseen proprietary trading, also left the bank last month. Prosecutors in Düsseldorf said Wednesday that they were investigating seven current and former WestLB board members for possible dereliction of their duty to keep the board informed of the bank's trading operations.News of the larger than expected trading losses is likely to put renewed pressure on WestLB to find a strong commercial partner or merge with another bank following several years of weak profits. The current liquidity crunch facing lenders in the short-term money markets - which is particularly acute in Germany - only serves to heighten this pressure.""These half-year results obviously reflect problems dating from before the current market trouble,"" said Andrea von Schnurbein, a banking sector analyst at Fitch Ratings in Frankfurt.WestLB and other German state-run banks have historically underperformed their private-sector peers, both in terms of earnings and capital adequacy. But in recent years, WestLB and others, like Leipzig-based SachsenLB, have grown increasingly aggressive in their investment strategies, hoping to offset weak growth in areas like retail lending with high-yielding bets on asset-backed securities, including many with exposure to subprime U.S. mortgages.The eastern German state of Saxony, which controls SachsenLB, agreed Sunday to sell the bank to Landesbank Baden-Württemberg after SachsenLB racked up more than €17 billion in exposure - equal to nearly one-third of its total assets - to off-balance sheet ""conduits"" that had invested in subprime mortgages and other assets.WestLB's declared exposure to conduits is equivalent to about 13 percent of assets, which places it significantly below SachsenLB but still well above most other major German lenders.WestLB said this month that it had direct exposure of about €1.25 billion in securities linked to the U.S. subprime market. On Thursday, it said it had set aside about €50 million in provisions for such investments. Hans-Jürgen Niehaus, the bank's chief financial officer, said he did not expect any ""larger"" losses from the subprime market in the second half.WestLB was approached by Landesbank Baden-Wuerttemberg, known as LBBW, about a possible merger earlier this year. The savings bank association of North Rhine-Westphalia voted in favor of a tie-up this week, but the state's legislature, which controls about 38 percent of the bank, has said that it wants to continue studying other options, including partnerships with other state lenders, or even selling a stake to a foreign investor.Von Schnurbein of Fitch Ratings said LBBW would have little difficulty finding the financial resources to absorb both SachsenLB and WestLB.""It is certainly strong enough to take another bank on board,"" she said.Analysts said WestLB had sufficient capital that there was not a risk of failure from its trading losses. But its inability to secure a significant foothold in the German retail and commercial banking markets left it vulnerable over the longer term."
1,"The entertainment for roughly 500 financial executives at the Deutsche Bank global derivatives conference last month in Barcelona did not come cheap: the Rolling Stones reportedly received more than $5 million.""The best part is, it's coming out of your bonuses,"" Mick Jagger, the lead singer, joked to the crowd.The hosts of the conference could well afford it. After all, the business of creating new finance vehicles like derivatives and structured products had exploded in recent years. And at the time of the conference just seven weeks ago, there remained a mostly rosy view of such investments, for their ability to help businesses and investors spread out risk.But the global financial turmoil - set off by problems with subprime mortgages - has prompted a backlash in some quarters against such financial engineering.More broadly, it has led to a better understanding of the downside of spreading risk so well - it can be felt in all corners of the world, roiling hedge funds, banks and stock markets as far as away as Australia and Germany. In effect, reducing risk on a global scale appears to have increased it for some players.""The market appears to be finding it harder to truly understand the inherent and underlying risks involved,"" said Chris Rexworthy, who was a regulator with Britain's Financial Services Authority for 10 years before moving recently to the private sector.In the United States, regulators and lawmakers appear to think that the new and often unregulated investment vehicles - which have shrunk the world and speeded up business in much the same way as the Internet did - are not all inherently flawed. Rather, it is up to investors to scrutinize more closely what they are buying.This opinion is captured in an analogy offered by Peter Douglas, the founder of GFIA, a hedge fund research firm in Singapore. He likens using derivatives to power tools. If you know how to use them, he said, they are exponentially better and faster for building a house, compared to using hammers, screwdrivers and handsaws.If you don't, ""you could drill a hole in your head,"" he said.Funds and banks around the world have taken hits because they purchased bonds, or securities related to bonds, backed by bad home loans, often bundled into financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations, or CDOs.The losses have often surprised their investors, and in same cases the funds and banks' own executives, who were unaware of the extent of their risks.The crisis extended as far as the $2.2 trillion money market that finances the day-to-day operations of businesses, as investors wondered whether the underlying assets were sound. ""It's amazing how much ignorance and fear are out there,"" said Kevin Davis, a professor of finance at the University of Melbourne.The confusion about these products lies in part because they are so complex.Structured products are pooled assets that have been sliced and diced into ever more smaller, more specialized pieces.They offered investors higher returns at a time when traditional fixed-income, or debt-related products, were producing low returns. As low interest rates fueled a lending boom to borrowers with weak credit, banks looked for new ways to package those loans, so they could sell more. A central building block to offset the risk was asset-backed securities, which are bonds backed by pools of mortgages or other income-producing assets, such as student loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables.Banks and other financial institutions pooled those asset-backed securities into new pools, dividing them up again and issuing securities against them, creating collateralized debt obligations.The idea took off, with new combinations that were further removed from the original asset. New creations included CDOs of CDOs, called CDO-squared. There is even a CDO-cubed.According to JPMorgan, there are about $1.5 trillion in collateralized debt obligations, and about $500 billion to $600 billion in structured finance CDOs, referring to those made up of bonds backed by subprime mortgages, slightly safer mortgages and commercial mortgage backed securities.Many of the products have proven to be highly problematic as the underlying assets - the subprime mortgages - have gone bust, revealing dangerous levels of leverage in the securities and very few people who know how to figure out their value. As a result, they have become like a potent computer virus, leaving many people fearful that they too will be affected.""A lot of risk in the subprime asset-backed market is embedded in, and amplified by, CDOs,"" said Rod Dubitsky, head of asset-backed research at Credit Suisse.When defaults in subprime loans started to rise, the impact was felt faster and further than if all the complex asset-backed products did not exist.Weaknesses in the system were laid bare, including ratings that did not accurately reflect risk and faulty assumptions on how diversified pools would act and multiple layers of leverage.That in turn unsettled investors in other markets as well who started selling anything they thought might be risky at all, from stocks to loans, and in some cases putting their money into cash.The advent of radically more complex structured products coincided with another trend in finance: the explosion of credit derivatives, financial tools that enabled institutions like banks and hedge funds to try and hedge exposure to the vast credit market, like loans to corporations, or ownership of corporate bonds.""Credit derivatives are the fastest growing part of any bank,"" said Derek Smith, head of flow credit trading at Deutsche Bank. He cited growth in 2007 of 80 percent for his company and average annual growth of about 40 percent for the industry.Blythe Masters, a veteran of the credit derivatives revolution and the head of global derivatives at JPMorgan Chase, added, ""There has been a wall of money coming at the credit markets in the past five years.""Credit default swaps (what are widely known as a credit derivatives) allow two parties to exchange the credit risk of an issuer, like a company. For example, if an investor buys a credit default swap on General Motors, called buying protection, he or she makes money when the credit weakens and makes a lot of money if GM goes bankrupt.In the meantime, the seller of protection makes a fee from the buyer and profits if the company's credit improves.Credit derivatives radically shifted the financial landscape for two reasons: they allowed banks to hedge some of their exposure to the huge loans they gave corporations, and they have allowed investors to bet against, or short credit, as a hedge and to speculate.For banks, shedding exposure to the credit risk of companies, or governments or individuals means not having to reserve as much capital for potential losses. That frees up capital to make even more loans - to homeowners, institutional investors, corporations or hedge funds.""In the early 1990s, the bank made loans to a company,"" recalled Masters of JPMorgan. ""But how much was too much? When you reached the limit of capacity, you were shut down with doing business. Now you could buy credit protection and free up capacity for more business.""The banks found a perfect partner in hedge funds, lightly regulated pools of capital with high fees that were looking for better returns. Insurance companies and pension funds also sought the higher returns, called yield, as interest rates hit historically low rates.Conceptually, the advent of credit derivatives meant spreading out risk and minimizing the potential D-Day effect of a big bank blow-up. ""Fundamentally, having 100 or 1,000 people with a slice of the risk is better than a bank holding 100 percent of the risk,"" said Robert Pickel, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.As the market for CDOs backed by structured products choked in recent weeks, the credit derivatives market has performed well, say participants.""Credit derivatives have done a good job at doing exactly what they should do: They have accurately and immediately reflected the markets' pricing of risk throughout this crisis,"" Masters said. ""That's a good thing. They have also offered liquidity.""But there has been a lot of pain as well. Investors purchasing derivatives are making a bet that the underlying stock or bond or loan is going to rise or fall, but they don't own it. Because buying a derivative requires much less capital than buying the loan or bond it is derived from, banks and traders can buy more of them than they could loans or bonds. That can translate into huge gains - or, in times of stress, outsized losses.Some institutions are not parsing what products are riskier than others, but rather they are rushing for the door. First State Investments, based in Singapore, has cut its holdings in all Asian financial firms in recent weeks.At this point ""it doesn't really matter what their exposure is"" to subprime products through derivatives, said Alistair Thompson, the deputy head of Asia-Pacific equities at First State. ""What concerns us is the sentiment"" in the market, he said.Predicting where the next subprime related blowup could come from, or even the size of the problem in Asia, has proven difficult for analysts and rating agents.Goldman Sachs, for example, in an Aug. 16 report, downgraded its outlook on Asian financial stocks from ""attractive"" to ""neutral,"" estimating that there was as much as $172 billion in worldwide losses from mortgage loans that have gone bad, nearly double the estimate from the Federal Reserve.Moody's, on the other hand, said earlier in August that Asian banks exposure to the problem would be ""limited"" and ""manageable"" without being more specific.The surprises are certainly not over: there were whispers among investors in Australia this week that some local funds are still turning up unexpected subprime exposure because of credit derivatives, weeks after the problems first surfaced.Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that it will be another three to six months before all of Asian banks exposure to subprime losses turns up.While that happens, markets are sure to remain skittish. ""Liquidity can just be turned off, and essentially it is a confidence game,"" said Thompson."
2,"Zero-interest financing, a familiar sales incentive at car dealerships and furniture stores, has found its way to another big-ticket consumer market: doctors' and dentists' offices.For $3,500 laser eye surgery, $6,000 ceramic tooth implants or other procedures not typically covered by insurance, millions of consumers have arranged financing through more than 100,000 doctors and dentists that offer a year or more of interest-free monthly payments.Of course, going into debt to pay for medical procedures is nothing new for many people. And this type of financing is still only a fraction of the nation's $900 billion market for consumer revolving credit.But as the price of health care continues to rise and big lenders pursue new areas for growth, this type of medical financing has become one of the fastest-growing parts of consumer credit, led by lending giants like Capital One and Citigroup and the CareCredit unit of General Electric.Big insurers, too, are devising new financing plans with various payback options. Upstart players have also aggressively cut deals with doctors.The room for expansion looks ample, as rising deductibles, co-payments and other costs may force more of the nation's 250 million people with health insurance to finance out-of-pocket expenses for even basic medical care.""As more and more of the costs of care are shifted to consumers, people are going to need more credit,"" said Red Gillen, a senior analyst at Celent, an insurance and banking research firm. ""They are still going to need health care.""The zero-interest plans are not for everyone. In fact, they are available only to the creditworthy — meaning they offer no help to those among the nation's 47 million uninsured who are in difficult financial situations.And creditworthiness is starting to be judged even more stringently, in light of the subprime mortgage crisis's impact on the debt markets, according to David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a newsletter for the credit card industry.Even for those who can get credit approval, the plans make sense only if users are able to make payments on time and close the loan on schedule, typically within 12 months. Otherwise, the loans after defaults can carry interest rates of 20 percent or more — similar to the default penalty on a typical credit card.""We are very careful to tell patients upfront, 'Be sure you can make your payments,' "" said Dr. Richard Mercurio, a dentist in Lincroft, New Jersey. He arranges patient financing through the CareCredit unit of GE, the leader in consumer medical financing.Mercurio says he knows of at least two patients who missed payments and received monthly bills charging high interest rates. ""They were not happy,"" he said.For those who are able to make their payments, though, the plans can make it possible to receive treatments that otherwise might be out of reach.""There was no way I had $6,000 right out of my pocket,"" said Nancy Schlachter, 40, who has dental insurance through her job as an accounts payable manager for a national construction company. She went to Mercurio for a series of dental procedures including a new crown, fillings and a tooth implant.""The implant was very expensive, and it was not covered,"" Schlachter said. But the dentist's office arranged 12-month zero-interest financing. ""It was the only way I could do it,"" she said.Some consumer debt experts warn that as more people try to bridge widening gaps in their health insurance, paying for medical care on credit could plunge the unwary into a financial crisis. In recent years, the use of high-interest credit cards to pay big medical bills has become a leading cause of consumer bankruptcy.""Unless they are at risk of losing life or limb, people should be very cautious about putting medical bills on credit cards,"" said Mark Rukavina, executive director of the Access Project, a research and consumer advocacy organization that helps people with their medical debts.Still, consumer credit companies and some insurers are now experimenting with financing plans meant specifically for medical costs.For people who think they could not pay off a zero-interest loan within a year, most credit companies also offer longer-term medical financing deals with 12 percent to 13 percent interest payable over several years. Those plans, though, must be arranged at the outset of the medical expense; a zero-interest plan typically cannot be converted to the longer-term program if consumers find themselves unable to pay off the one-year loans.Some insurers, including UnitedHealthcare, also have special credit plans available for insured members whose policies are linked to health savings accounts. Such policies combine high-deductible insurance with tax-sheltered savings accounts where money can roll over year to year until needed for medical expenses. But typically, the amounts of money being set aside do not go very far toward meeting even routine health expenses.So far, among the 1.76 million health savings accounts in this country, the average balance is $1,327, according to a recent survey by Inside Consumer-Directed Care, a trade publication. To help people with health savings accounts meet the shortfall, the Exante Bank unit of UnitedHealth Group is trying out a card that extends credit at rates currently averaging about 10 percent to 13 percent, depending on the applicant's credit history.UnitedHealthcare is also testing a medical credit card that would offer reduced rates.""There's a place for credit solutions that are integrated within traditional health insurance programs, when an individual hits that out-of-pocket expense,"" said Tom Beauregard, a senior vice president at UnitedHealthcare. ""The key is to make it voluntary, to make it simple and to offer favorable credit terms.""As for the zero-interest deals, the credit providers say that most of them end up being just that — interest-free. About 80 percent of the medical loans that CareCredit provides are paid off on schedule and incur no finance charges, according to the company's president, Michael Testa.That, the companies say, justifies the high default interest rates for late payments, since that is the way they recoup the costs of doing business. In fact, though, the credit companies make money even on the interest-free deals, because they are typically keeping 10 percent of the fee the doctor charges the patient. On a $5,000 cosmetic nose operation, for instance, the plastic surgeon might receive only $4,500.Another of the medical finance companies, HELPcard, says that for dentists whose customers are good credit risks, the lender's commission might be only 4 percent to 5 percent. But for patients with low credit ratings, a dentist eager to build a clientele might have to accept as little as 75 percent of the bill, said Pat McGee, HELPcard's senior vice president for sales and marketing.The CareCredit unit of GE, too, has special deals for patients whose credit is not well established. Stephanie Waterman, a coordinator for Dello Russo Laser Vision, a laser-surgery practice with offices in New York and Bergenfield, New Jersey, said patients deemed less creditworthy were required to pay $600 in cash and to agree to have 12 months of zero-interest payments taken directly from their bank accounts.One Dello Russo patient, Senior Airman Derrick Fields, 31, stationed at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, said that in June he paid $600 down on a $3,500 surgery bill for both eyes — a reduced charge the practice offers to members of the military.""They take about $250 a month from my bank account,"" said Fields, who said he soon expected to not wear eyeglasses for the first time since the second grade. ""I owe $2,900."""
3,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 — President Bush, in his first response to low-income families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, plans to announce several steps Friday aimed at helping Americans with credit difficulties to meet the rising cost of their housing loans, administration officials said Thursday.The officials said Mr. Bush would call for the Federal Housing Administration to raise the ceilings on what it can charge for federal mortgage insurance, a move that they said would enable an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records to take advantage of the program, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes and what one official called “jawboning” of banks and other lending institutions to avoid foreclosing on distressed mortgage holders.Administration officials briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals to be announced by President Bush, apparently to generate attention for these steps at a time of rising Democratic criticism and to demonstrate concern for Americans anxious over their ability to pay their housing costs.Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Mr. Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half.Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is certain to spike in coming weeks and months even as the value of their homes declines. Many are considered likely to default, possibly increasing the global turmoil in the financial markets.In addition, Mr. Bush is expected to endorse several proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of mortgage insurance available for refinancing and to provide tax relief to those who renegotiate their mortgages to their financial advantage.The recent turmoil in the financial markets was prompted in part by a decline in housing values in the United States, a rise in interest rates and the prospect that mortgage holders will default on their payments. That prospect in turn is causing losses to investors and lenders around the world."
4,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 31 — President Bush, in his first response to families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, announced several steps today to help Americans who have credit problems meet the rising cost of their housing loans.In remarks this morning at the White House, Mr. Bush said he would work to “modernize and improve” the Federal Housing Administration “by lowering down payment requirements, by increasing loan limits, and providing more flexibility in pricing.”Administration officials said in advance of Mr. Bush’s appearance that the goal would be to change its federal mortgage insurance program in a way that would let an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records sign up, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.“It’s not the government’s job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford,” Mr. Bush said. “Yet there are many American homeowners who can get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or little help from their government.”The administration is offering his plan, which will include what one official called jawboning of lenders to persuade them not to foreclose on some borrowers, at a time of growing attacks on Mr. Bush from Democrats who say he has remained on the sidelines amid increasing anxiety over whether millions of Americans could end up losing their homes. Other elements of the plan would need legislative action, requiring Mr. Bush to win over the Democratic leadership in Congress.He called for Congress to act quickly.“The recent disturbances in the subprime mortgage industry are modest — they’re modest in relation to the size of our economy,” Mr. Bush said this morning. “But if your family is — if your family’s one of those having trouble making the monthly payments, this problem doesn’t seem modest at all.”The main objective of the package, one senior official said, is not to affect the stock markets but to help low-income homeowners, many of them concentrated in certain neighborhoods in several distressed areas of the country, such as Ohio and Michigan.“The primary focus is to help individuals who have an opportunity to stay in their homes to stay in their homes,” this official said. “The subprime mortgage situation is having a crushing effect on a lot of communities right now.”Administration officials, who asked not to be identified, briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals on Thursday evening. Despite the assertion that affecting the markets is not the goal, one administration official said concern about Wall Street’s reaction did affect the timing of the briefing. He said there was a fear that if the White House announced in the morning that Mr. Bush would be making an announcement on housing, there could be confusion as buyers and sellers of mortgage securities guessed what the announcement would be.But secondarily, this official said, helping homeowners keep their homes and refinance or renegotiate the terms of the mortgages could have a stabilizing effect on the financial institutions that have these mortgages in their portfolios, and help them write down the value of the mortgages or sell them off at a loss.“You can’t solve the problems in the financial markets unless you can make some progress on the retail end of it,” said this official. “This is also a step to get banks to start loaning again.”Another factor in the decision to disclose details ahead of time was that Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was planning to give a speech on housing this morning at the Fed’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., and that speculation about his comments would also unsettle the markets.As they put together the proposals, top administration officials consulted with financial institutions, some members of Congress, housing counseling groups, academic specialists, and also with Mr. Bernanke.Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes. Mr. Bush, for example, is expected to endorse proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of a mortgage that can be refinanced with federal insurance.He is also expected to support legislation that would provide tax breaks to homeowners whose mortgage debt is forgiven, in whole or in part, by lenders. The federal government currently collects taxes on the amount of a loan that is forgiven.Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Mr. Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half.These two million mortgages, all held by homeowners with credit problems and with homes that are declining in value, are valued at $500 billion to $600 billion, administration officials said. The total value of American mortgages is about $10 trillion.Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is expected to soar in coming weeks and months. With their home values declining, many are considered likely to default, possibly adding to the global turmoil in the financial markets. The administration officials who briefed reporters sought to underscore Mr. Bush’s willingness to work with Democrats, an unusual display of bipartisanship from an administration that has tangled with Democrats on many economic and budget issues.The administration’s legislative proposals are likely to be similar to bills that Congressional Democrats have proposed, but there is still room for considerable argument over details. In general, the administration wants home buyers to pay for any measure that might help them, and Democrats want measures that provide extra help to people with low or moderate incomes.But administration officials said they would continue to oppose one measure that Democrats strongly endorse: an increase in the total dollar value of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing-finance companies, can hold in their investment portfolios.Until now, Mr. Bush and his top economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., have focused on the broad prospects of the American and global economies and the disarray in financial markets.Two weeks ago, when asked about the problems of mortgage holders, Mr. Bush said that many Americans struggling with their mortgages had failed to read the fine print on the loans.But some in the administration and some Republicans are also concerned that there has not been enough talk from Mr. Bush about lower-income homeowners. These Republicans have said the administration’s response so far is reminiscent of its initial delays in relief after Hurricane Katrina two years ago.The plans to be outlined by Mr. Bush are to be in the form of administrative actions taken unilaterally and proposals for enactment by Congress, many of them already in various bills sponsored by leading Democrats.Among the Democrats with such proposals are Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; and Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.One senior official said, however, that the administration would encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help low-income holders of subprime mortgages refinance or renegotiate the loans, rather than lifting the companies’ investment limits.Mr. Frank has said that the administration is ideologically opposed to letting the two mortgage agencies play a role in assisting homeowners in the current crisis, but the administration official said that was a misconception.Mr. Bush also plans to enlist Mr. Paulson and Alphonso R. Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to consider regulating home-lending practices in the future to crack down on predatory practices. In addition, they are to study the role of credit-rating agencies, some of which have been accused of giving unrealistically positive ratings to packages of mortgages, which were then acquired by hedge funds and other institutions.One official said the administration’s proposals would not include a bailout of institutions that bought mortgages that have plummeted in value.“We are not using the b-word,” he said, referring to the talk of bailing out lenders.One economist said the efforts seem well intentioned. The F.H.A. can help provide another option to homeowners who need to refinance, and the government should do what it can to encourage mortgage companies to modify loans, rather than foreclosing on them.The administration could also help homeowners in higher-priced markets by temporarily raising the $417,000 limit on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy from mortgage companies, said the economist, Thomas Davidoff, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.But he noted all the efforts would likely only have a limited impact, given the number of loans resetting to higher interest rates in the coming months.“This is helpful. But you had millions of people taking loans they should not have been taking, and investors lending money at too low interest rates,” Mr. Davidoff said. “Nothing is going to make those bad decisions go away.”"
5,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (AP) — The economy enjoyed a strong revival in the spring, although growing troubles in housing and credit markets have darkened prospects considerably since then.The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of economic health, expanded at an annual rate of 4 percent in the April-June quarter, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. That was the strongest showing in more than a year and considerably higher than the 3.4 percent estimate for growth made a month ago.The performance reflected increased activity in areas like international trade and business investment, offseting a continued plunge in housing construction.But that growth could be the best showing for some time as the economy continues to be battered by the worst housing slump in 16 years and a widening credit crisis that has made financial markets highly volatile in recent weeks.“The economy has taken a significant blow from the turmoil in financial markets and the housing downturn, which is intensifying,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’sEconomy.com.Many economists said they expected growth to slow to around 2 percent in the current quarter, just half the spring pace, and perhaps dip below 2 percent in the final three months of the year as the impact from the market turbulence on consumer and business confidence takes more of a toll.But analysts said they still believed that the economy, whose current expansion will be six years old in November, would be able to avoid a full-blown recession.“While a recession in the United States is clearly possible,” said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at Global Insight, a research firm, “one of the biggest positives going forward is that the rest of the world still looks good, which means we will get continued help from rising exports.”An improved trade performance, representing higher sales of American products overseas and lower imports, was the biggest contributor to the second-quarter improvement, adding 1.4 percentage points to the 4 percent growth rate.Analysts said they were confident that the Federal Reserve would act in time to ward off a recession by cutting interest rates should current financial troubles intensify.In a second report Thursday, the Labor Department said the number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits rose for a fifth consecutive week, increasing by 9,000, to 334,000 last week, the highest level since April.Analysts said some of those gains probably came from rising layoffs in the mortgage industry, where many firms specializing in offering subprime loans have had to cut workers or close."

Foreign politicians and regulators are seeking a role in the oversight of American markets, banks and rating agencies. The head of the Council of Economic Analysis in France has called for complex securities to be scrutinized before banks are authorized to buy them.In the United States, regulators appear to think that the new and often unregulated investment vehicles — which have shrunk the world and speeded up business in much the same way as the Internet — are not all inherently flawed.This opinion is captured in an analogy offered by Peter Douglas, the founder of GFIA, a hedge fund research firm in Singapore.

If you know how to use them, he said, they are exponentially better and faster for building a house, compared with using hammers, screwdrivers and handsaws.If you don’t, “you could drill a hole in your head,"" he said.Funds and banks around the world have taken hits because they purchased bonds, or risk related to bonds, backed by bad home loans, often bundled into financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations, or C.D.O.’s.The losses have often surprised the investors, and in some cases the funds and the executives of the banks, who were unaware of the extent of their risks.The crisis extended as far as the $2.2 trillion money market that finances the day-to-day operations of businesses, as investors wondered whether the underlying assets were sound. “It’s amazing how much ignorance and fear are out there,” said Kevin Davis, a professor of finance at the University of Melbourne.The confusion about these products lies in part in their complexity. Structured products are pooled assets that have been sliced and diced into ever more smaller, more specialized pieces.They offered investors higher returns at a time when traditional fixed income, or debt-related products, were producing low returns.As low interest rates fueled a lending boom to borrowers with weak credit, banks looked for new ways to package those loans, so they could sell more. A central building block to offset the risk was asset-backed securities, which are bonds backed by pools of mortgages or other income-producing assets, like student loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables.Banks and other financial institutions pooled those asset-backed securities into new units, dividing them up again and issuing securities against them, creating collateralized debt obligations.The idea took off, with new combinations that were further removed from the original asset. New creations included C.D.O.’s of C.D.O.’s, called C.D.O.-squared. There is even a C.D.O.-cubed.According to JPMorgan, there are about $1.5 trillion in global collateralized debt obligations, and about $500 billion to $600 billion in structured-finance C.D.O.’s, referring to those made up of bonds backed by subprime mortgages, slightly safer mortgages and commercial mortgage backed securities.Many of the products have proved to be highly problematic as the underlying assets — the subprime mortgages — have gone bust, revealing dangerous amounts of leverage in the securities that few people could value. As a result, they have become like a potent computer virus, leaving many people fearful that they too will be affected.“A lot of risk in the subprime asset-backed market is embedded in, and amplified by, C.D.O.’s,” said Rod Dubitsky, head of asset-backed research at Credit Suisse.Weaknesses in the system were laid bare, including ratings that did not accurately reflect risk and faulty assumptions on how diversified pools with multiple layers of leverage would react.That in turn spooked investors in other markets, who started selling anything they thought might be risky, from stocks to loans, and in some cases putting their money into cash.The combination of a subprime shock, “untested financial innovation and leverage has led to a confidence crisis,” said Pierre Cailleteau, Moody’s Investors Service chief economist in London.The advent of radically more complex structured products coincided with another trend in finance: the explosion of credit derivatives, financial tools that enabled institutions like banks and hedge funds to try to hedge exposure to the huge credit market, like loans to corporations.“Credit derivatives are the fastest-growing part of any bank,” says Derek Smith, head of flow credit trading at Deutsche Bank. He cited 80 percent growth in 2007 for his firm and average annual growth of about 40 percent for the industry.Blythe Masters, a veteran of the credit derivatives revolution and the global head of commodities at JPMorgan Securities, added, “There has been a wall of money coming at the credit markets in the past five years.”Credit default swaps (what are widely known as a credit derivatives) allow two parties to exchange the credit risk of an issuer, such as a company. For example, if an investor buys a credit default swap on General Motors, called buying protection, he or she makes money when the credit weakens and makes a lot of money if G.M. goes bankrupt.In the meantime, the seller of protection makes a fee from the buyer and profits if the company’s credit improves.Credit derivatives radically shifted the financial landscape for two reasons: they allowed banks to hedge some of their exposure to the huge loans they give corporations, and they have allowed investors to bet against, or short credit, as a hedge and to speculate.For banks, shedding exposure to the credit risk of companies, or governments, or individuals, means not having to reserve as much capital for potential losses. That frees up capital to make even more loans — to homeowners, institutional investors, corporations or hedge funds.The banks found a perfect partner in hedge funds, lightly regulated pools of capital with high fees that were looking for better returns. Insurance companies and pension funds also sought the higher returns, called yield, as interest rates hit historically low rates.“Fundamentally, having 100 or 1,000 people with a slice of the risk is better than a bank holding 100 percent of the risk,” said Robert G. Pickel, chief executive of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.As the market for C.D.O.’s backed by structured products choked in recent weeks, the overall credit derivatives market has performed well, say some industry participants.“Credit derivatives have done a good job at doing exactly what they should do: they have accurately and immediately reflected the markets’ pricing of risk throughout this crisis,” Ms. Masters said. But there has been a lot of pain. Investors purchasing derivatives are making a bet that the underlying stock or bond or loan is going to rise or fall, but they do not own it. Because buying a derivative requires much less capital than buying the loan or bond it is derived from, banks and traders can buy more of them than they could loans or bonds. That can translate into huge gains — or, in times of stress, outsize losses.Some institutions are not parsing what products are riskier than others, but rather they are rushing for the door. First State Investments in Singapore has slashed its holdings in all Asian financial firms in recent weeks.At this point “it doesn’t really matter what their exposure is” to subprime products through derivatives, said Alistair Thompson, the deputy head of Asia-Pacific equities at First State. “What concerns us is the sentiment” in the market, he said.The surprises are certainly not over: there were whispers among investors in Australia this week that some local funds were still turning up unexpected subprime exposure because of credit derivatives, weeks after the problems first surfaced.While that happens, markets are sure to remain skittish.“Liquidity can just be turned off, and essentially it is a confidence game,” Mr. Thompson said."
7,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 30 (AP)  Freddie Mac, the nation’s No. 2 buyer and backer of home mortgages, set aside more than $300 million in the second quarter to account for bad loans, contributing to a 45 percent drop in profit.The company is seen as a source of housing market stability, along with its larger government-sponsored sibling Fannie Mae. Nevertheless, Freddie Mac, based in McLean, Va., said it had recorded the provision for credit losses in the quarter because of problems with loans originated this year and last year.The action comes amid a deepening mortgage crisis nationwide that has bankrupted more than 50 lenders, many of them ones that had served borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit.Shares in Freddie Mac closed down 5 percent, at $60.07.Freddie Mac said it was experiencing higher delinquency rates on the East and West Coasts, and not just in areas of the Midwest with high unemployment.The company said losses from defaulted mortgages, while still a tiny portion of its mortgage portfolio, rose to 0.02 percent in the second quarter and were expected to keep rising into next year. While those losses are worsening, they are still below average for the company, the chief financial officer, Anthony S. Piszel, said.“Given the credit environment, we think we performed reasonably well,” he said.The government-sponsored company, which is returning to normality after an accounting scandal four years ago, makes money from interest payments on mortgages it holds on its books and on fees from insuring mortgages sold to investors.It earned $764 million, or $1.02 a share, for the three months that ended June 30. That compares with profit of $1.4 billion, or $1.93 a share, a year ago.The results missed Wall Street expectations, with analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial expecting a profit of $1.16 a share on revenue of $1.69 billion for the quarter. Revenue rose 4.8 percent, to $2.26 billion, from $2.15 billion in the quarter a year ago."
8,"WASHINGTON —President George W. Bush, in his first response to families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, announced several steps Friday to help Americans who have credit problems meet the rising cost of their housing loans.In remarks at the White House, Bush said he would work to ""modernize and improve"" the Federal Housing Administration ""by lowering downpayment requirements, by increasing loan limits and providing more flexibility in pricing.""Administration officials said in advance of Bush's appearance that the goal would be to change its federal mortgage insurance program in a way that would let an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records sign up, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.""It's not the government's job to bail out speculators or those who made the decision to buy a home they knew they could never afford,"" Bush said. ""Yet there are many American homeowners who can get through this difficult time with a little flexibility from their lenders or little help from their government.""The administration is offering its plan - which will include what one official called ""jawboning"" of lenders to persuade them not to foreclose on some borrowers - at a time of growing attacks on Bush from Democrats who say he has remained on the sidelines amid increasing anxiety over whether millions of Americans could end up losing their homes. Other elements of the plan would need legislative action, requiring Bush to win over the Democratic leadership in Congress.He called for Congress to act quickly.""The recent disturbances in the subprime mortgage industry are modest - they're modest in relation to the size of our economy,"" Bush said. ""But if your family is - if your family's one of those having trouble making the monthly payments, this problem doesn't seem modest at all.""The main objective of the package, a senior official said, is not to affect the stock markets but to help low-income homeowners, many of them concentrated in certain neighborhoods in several distressed areas of the country, such as Ohio and Michigan.""The primary focus is to help individuals who have an opportunity to stay in their homes to stay in their homes,"" this official said. ""The subprime mortgage situation is having a crushing effect on a lot of communities right now."" As they put together the proposals, top administration officials consulted with financial institutions, some members of Congress, housing counseling groups, academic specialists, and also with Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.Bush was to endorse proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of a mortgage that can be refinanced with federal insurance. He was also expected to support legislation that would provide tax breaks to homeowners whose mortgage debt is forgiven, in whole or in part, by lenders. The federal government currently collects taxes on the amount of a loan that is forgiven.Democratic presidential candidates and Congressional leaders have hammered the administration in recent weeks, charging Bush with indifference to the plight of an estimated two million homeowners whose mortgage costs are expected to go up in the next year and a half. These two million mortgages, all held by homeowners with credit problems and with homes that are declining in value, are valued at $500 billion to $600 billion, administration officials said. The total value of American mortgages is about $10 trillion.Many of these homeowners are lower-income families caught in the squeeze of variable-rate mortgages whose cost is expected to soar in coming weeks and months. With their home values declining, many are considered likely to default, possibly adding to the global turmoil in the financial markets.The administration's legislative proposals are likely to be similar to bills that Congressional Democrats have proposed, but there is still room for considerable argument over details. In general, the administration wants home buyers to pay for any measure that might help them, and Democrats want measures that provide extra help to people with low or moderate incomes.Administration officials said they would continue to oppose one measure that Democrats strongly endorse: an increase in the total dollar value of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing-finance companies, can hold in their investment portfolios.Until now, Bush and his top economic advisers, particularly the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., have focused on the broad prospects of the American and global economies and the disarray in financial markets.Two weeks ago, when asked about the problems of mortgage holders, Bush said that many Americans struggling with their mortgages had failed to read the fine print on the loans.But some in the administration and some Republicans are also concerned that there has not been enough talk from Bush about lower-income homeowners. These Republicans have said the administration's response so far is reminiscent of its initial delays in relief after Hurricane Katrina two years ago.Bush also plans to enlist Paulson and Alphonso Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to consider regulating home-lending practices in the future to crack down on predatory practices. In addition, they are to study the role of credit-rating agencies, some of which have been accused of giving unrealistically positive ratings to packages of mortgages, which were then acquired by hedge funds and other institutions.One official said the proposals would not include a bailout of institutions that bought mortgages that have plummeted in value.""We are not using the b-word,"" he said, referring to the talk of bailing out lenders."
9,"NEW YORK —The evening entertainment for about 500 financial executives at the Deutsche Bank global derivatives conference in Barcelona in July did not come cheap - the Rolling Stones reportedly were paid more than $5 million.""The best part is - it's coming out of your bonuses,"" Mick Jagger joked to the audience.The hosts of the conference could well afford it. After all, the business of creating finance vehicles like derivatives and structured products has exploded in recent years. And at the time of the conference, there remained a mostly rosy view of such instruments, for their ability to help businesses and investors spread out risk.But the global financial turmoil - triggered by problems with U.S. subprime mortgages - has prompted a backlash in some quarters against such financial engineering.More broadly, it has led to a better understanding of the downside of spreading risk so well - it can be felt in all corners of the world, roiling hedge funds, banks and stock markets. In effect, reducing risk on a global scale appears to have increased it for some players.Funds and banks around the world have taken hits because they purchased bonds, or risk related to bonds, backed by bad home loans, often bundled into financial instruments called collateralized debt obligations.The losses have often surprised their investors, and in same cases the funds and banks' own executives, who were unaware of the extent of their risks.The crisis extended as far as the $2.2 trillion money market that funds the day-to-day operations of businesses, as investors wondered whether the underlying assets were sound. ""It's amazing how much ignorance and fear are out there,"" said Kevin Davis, a professor of finance at the University of Melbourne.The confusion about these products lies in part because they are so complex. Structured products are pooled assets that have been sliced and diced into ever more smaller, more specialized pieces.They offered investors higher returns at a time when traditional fixed income, or debt-related products, were producing low returns.As low interest rates fueled a lending boom to borrowers with weak credit, banks looked for new ways to package those loans, so they could sell more. A central building block to offset the risk was asset-backed securities, which are bonds backed by pools of mortgages or other income-producing assets, like student loans, auto loans, and credit card receivables.Banks and other financial institutions pooled those asset-backed securities into new pools, dividing them up again and issuing securities against them, creating collateralized debt obligations.The idea took off, with new combinations that were further removed from the original asset. New creations included collateralized debt obligations of collateralized debt obligations, called CDO-squared. There is even a CDO-cubed.According to J.P.

10,"WASHINGTON —President George W. Bush, in his first response to families hit by the subprime mortgage crisis, plans to announce several steps Friday to help Americans who have credit problems meet the rising cost of their housing loans, administration officials said Thursday.The officials said Bush would call for the Federal Housing Administration to change its federal mortgage insurance program in a way that would let an additional 80,000 homeowners with spotty credit records sign up, beyond the 160,000 likely to use it this year and next.The administration is offering his plan, which will include what one official called jawboning of lenders to persuade them not to foreclose on some borrowers, at a time of growing attacks on Bush from Democrats who say he has remained on the sidelines amid increasing anxiety over whether millions of Americans could end up losing their homes. Other elements of the plan would need legislative action, requiring Bush to win over the Democratic leadership in Congress.Administration officials, who asked not to be identified, briefed a handful of news organizations on the proposals to be announced by Bush at an appearance in the White House Rose Garden on Friday morning.The main objective of the package, one senior official said, is not to affect the stock markets but to help low-income homeowners, many of them concentrated in certain neighborhoods in several distressed areas of the country, such as Ohio and Michigan.""The primary focus is to help individuals who have an opportunity to stay in their homes to stay in their homes,"" this official said. ""The subprime mortgage situation is having a crushing effect on a lot of communities right now.""Despite the assertion that affecting the markets is not the goal, one administration official said Thursday evening that concern about Wall Street's reaction did affect the timing of the briefing. He said there was a fear that if the White House announced in the morning that Bush would be making an announcement on housing, there could be confusion as buyers and sellers of mortgage securities guessed what the announcement would be.But secondarily, this official said, helping homeowners keep their homes and refinance or renegotiate the terms of the mortgages could have a stabilizing effect on the financial institutions that have these mortgages in their portfolios, and help them write down the value of the mortgages or sell them off at a loss.""You can't solve the problems in the financial markets unless you can make some progress on the retail end of it,"" said this official. ""This is also a step to get banks to start loaning again.""Another factor in the decision to disclose details ahead of time was that Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, was planning to give a speech on housing on Friday at the Fed's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and that speculation about his comments would also unsettle the markets.As they put together the proposals, top administration officials consulted with financial institutions, some members of Congress, housing counseling groups, academic specialists, and also with Bernanke.Several other steps the administration plans to announce involve seeking legislative changes. Bush, for example, is expected to endorse proposals backed by Democrats in Congress that would raise the ceiling on the amount of a mortgage that can be refinanced with federal insurance.He is also expected to support legislation that would provide tax breaks to homeowners whose mortgage debt is forgiven, in whole or in part, by lenders.

With their home values declining, many are considered likely to default, possibly adding to the global turmoil in the financial markets. The administration officials who briefed reporters sought to underscore Bush's willingness to work with Democrats, an unusual display of bipartisanship from an administration that has tangled with Democrats on many economic and budget issues.The administration's legislative proposals are likely to be similar to bills that congressional Democrats have proposed, but there is still room for considerable argument over details. In general, the administration wants home buyers to pay for any measure that might help them, and Democrats want measures that provide extra help to people with low or moderate incomes.But administration officials said they would continue to oppose one measure that Democrats strongly endorse: an increase in the total dollar value of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing-finance companies, can hold in their investment portfolios.Until now, Bush and his top economic advisers, particularly Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr., have focused on the broad prospects of the American and global economies and the disarray in financial markets.Two weeks ago, when asked about the problems of mortgage holders, Bush said that many Americans struggling with their mortgages had failed to read the fine print on the loans.But some in the administration and some Republicans are also concerned that there has not been enough talk from Bush about lower-income homeowners. These Republicans have said the administration's response so far is reminiscent of its initial delays in relief after Hurricane Katrina two years ago.The plans to be outlined by Bush are to be in the form of administrative actions taken unilaterally and proposals for enactment by Congress, many of them already in various bills sponsored by leading Democrats.Among the Democrats with such proposals are Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who is chairman of the House Financial Services Committee; Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee; and Senator Charles Schumer of New York, chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.One senior official said, however, that the administration would encourage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to help low-income holders of subprime mortgages refinance or renegotiate the loans, rather than lifting the companies' investment limits.Frank has said that the administration is ideologically opposed to letting the two mortgage agencies play a role in assisting homeowners in the current crisis, but the administration official said that was a misconception.Bush also plans to enlist Paulson and Alphonso Jackson, the secretary of housing and urban development, to consider regulating home-lending practices in the future to crack down on predatory practices. In addition, they are to study the role of credit-rating agencies, some of which have been accused of giving unrealistically positive ratings to packages of mortgages, which were then acquired by hedge funds and other institutions.One official said the administration's proposals would not include a bailout of institutions that bought mortgages that have plummeted in value.""We are not using the b-word,"" he said, referring to the talk of bailing out lenders.One economist said the efforts seem well intentioned. The FHA can help provide another option to homeowners who need to refinance, and the government should do what it can to encourage mortgage companies to modify loans, rather than foreclosing on them.The administration could also help homeowners in higher-priced markets by temporarily raising the $417,000 limit on loans that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can buy from mortgage companies, said the economist, Thomas Davidoff, an assistant professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.But he noted all the efforts would likely only have a limited impact, given the number of loans resetting to higher interest rates in the coming months.""This is helpful. But you had millions of people taking loans they should not have been taking, and investors lending money at too low interest rates,"" Davidoff said. ""Nothing is going to make those bad decisions go away."""

12,"Does it make sense for stock prices to plunge one day and soar the next, with little in the way of new information to explain either move?Maybe not, but it happened this week, just as it did earlier in August. It was the first time in more than four years that the American stock market experienced such wild swings, and could be a harbinger of a reversal of direction in either the stock market or the economy, or both.Or it could just show that changes in the financial system have left many investors confused about what is going on.In the past, such wild swings have sometimes indicated that markets were turning in a new direction. In retrospect, there seem to be good reasons for the turnaround. But at the time, there were also plenty of investors who believed that the prevailing trend was sure to continue and jumped in to drive prices in the old direction.In September 1974, with the economy in a severe recession and the stock market in the worst bear market since the Depression, there was a string of sharp, contradictory moves. Share prices hit bottom in early October, and a strong recovery followed.In 2000, the bull market was going strong, led by the technology stocks that had soared and made many traders feel rich. The first big reversal came in January, with prices plunging one day and recovering the next. It happened again in April, and again in October. The Internet bubble was finally deflating, and a prolonged bear market was beginning.By 2002, investors were as depressed as they had been in a generation. The 2001 recession was over, but that was not clear. A series of summer reversals signaled that a bottom was near, and was followed by more reversals in October, November and the following March. The bull market had revived.But while such reversals can signal major market moves, they can also occur when markets are stirred by changes that leave many investors simply perplexed. The 1987 crash, which seemed at the time to warn of impending recession, now appears to have been caused by a new investment strategy involving stock index futures that led to major selling after the first decline. The strategy, called portfolio insurance, decimated portfolios, but it did not reflect what was going on in the economy. Aided by quick action on the part of the Federal Reserve, the next recession was still three years away.Similarly, reversals in 1997 and 1998 came amid an Asian credit crisis, a Russian default on debt and problems with a hedge fund, Long-Term Capital Management, whose strategies were not as brilliant as its founders had believed. But they did not presage an end to the 1990s bull market.This year’s sharp moves have come as investors vacillated over how extensive the effects of the subprime mortgage problems will be. Those problems have led to a sharp contraction of credit markets and to difficulties for a number of hedge funds, but it is unclear if the crisis will also bring on a recession and end a bull market that has sent most stocks well above the highs they reached in 2000.To some traders, it is ridiculous to expect the entire economy to falter because of problems in the subprime mortgage market. That market is, as President Bush put it yesterday, “modest in relation to the size of our economy,” and the world economy remains strong.Others are convinced that tighter credit standards will force American consumers to curtail spending, slowing the economy and damaging corporate profits. It is from such contradictory beliefs that the wild days of August sprang."
13,"WHEN a crisis grips a segment of the market and the extent of the damage is unclear, investors are prone to err on the side of panic, selling until share prices account for just about everything that might go wrong. Then they shake their heads as bad news continues and the stocks rise.This drama is being staged again, with mortgage lenders cast in the lead. Many institutions are stuck with a growing number of bad loans and a limited ability to obtain financing to make new and better ones. Some smaller specialists in subprime mortgages have gone under, and the stocks of bigger companies like Countrywide Financial and IndyMac Bancorp have declined 40 percent or more.It may be tempting to go bargain hunting, but the prevailing opinion of investment advisers is that prices do not yet account for the difficulties that the industry is expected to face in the months, and possibly years, to come as the housing market deteriorates. Opportunities are far better, they say, in diversified banks that do a brisk mortgage business but do not depend on mortgages for the bulk of their revenues.Anatoliy Cherevach, a banking analyst for the Cohen & Steers Dividend Value fund, said that he thought the immediate credit squeeze was abating but that he expected another shoe to drop, though agonizingly slowly. “The other part of it  the credit quality issue  is still with us and probably will be for some time,” he said.Robert Sellar, head of American equities at Aberdeen Asset Management, said he envisioned a solution to the crisis, but real estate brokers would not like it. “We need to see a fall in home prices to reinvigorate the housing market,” he said.The funds of Mr. Sellar and Mr. Cherevach are avoiding the pure mortgage lenders, but John Buckingham, president of Al Frank Asset Management and editor of The Prudent Speculator newsletter, has taken a contrarian approach. He recommends the stocks of Countrywide, IndyMac and Washington Mutual, “all of which we expect to weather the storm, while ultimately taking market share and going on to thrive in the next up leg of the cycle,” he wrote in his newsletter.MR. Buckingham’s view that the crisis is dividing the mortgage industry into haves and have-nots is widely held. But other advisers are inclined to put pure mortgage banks on the wrong side of the line. They make their case by pointing to the deal last week between Countrywide and Bank of America.Bank of America, the nation’s largest retail bank but a moderate-size mortgage lender, agreed to buy $2 billion of Countrywide preferred stock. By most accounts, it was a sweet deal for Bank of America, which will receive a dividend yield of 7.25 percent and the right to buy one-sixth of Countrywide at a below-market price. It was more of a necessary deal for Countrywide, which will get access to financing to keep issuing mortgages.The arrangement is a hint of things to come, said Tom Atteberry, a fund manager at First Pacific Advisors. As weakness in the housing and credit markets persists, he expects shakier lenders to be squeezed on both sides of their earnings statements.Financing costs are likely to rise as the institutions’ troubles limit access to capital. At the same time, incomes may come under threat as lenders are forced to restrain their creativity and issue only conventional mortgages, and only to homebuyers who are sound risks.Such a situation could allow already great businesses to become even greater. Diversified, well-capitalized institutions like Wells Fargo and Bank of America should be able to step in and snap up mortgage portfolios on the cheap or increase their homegrown underwriting in a less crowded marketplace.Wells Fargo is especially admired; all four fund management firms hold the stock. Cohen & Steers owns Bank of America and other blue chips. Before any mortgage specialists are added, Mr. Cherevach said he would need to see “a hint of stabilization and an improvement in credit quality.”He is not holding his breath. “For the next several quarters we’ll see delinquencies going up,” he predicted."
14,"WALL STREET is debating whether difficulties in the credit markets will have a material impact on economic growth. If forecasts for this week’s data prove accurate, the economy would seem to be getting off lightly.Benign, even encouraging, reports are expected on employment, inflation and manufacturing, with the highlight likely to be the snapshot on Friday of employment conditions in August. A Bloomberg News poll of economists estimates that 115,000 net jobs were created last month, up from 92,000 in July.That prediction sounds about right to Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist at Citigroup Investment Research, but he advised investors to be circumspect about the report. Steady, even robust, job growth could be a sign that the subprime mortgage crisis is not producing subpar economic performance — but it’s also possible that it will take longer than expected for damage to surface.“A lot of the issue is not whether we can see economic weakness at the moment, but will a lack of availability of credit become an economic problem?” he said. “If businesses can’t borrow at reasonable terms, will we have economic fallout with some lag, maybe a month or two?”An important factor is how picky banks will become about lending. A tightening of lending standards, gleaned from a quarterly bank survey that the Federal Reserve compiles, tends to be followed by softness in job creation, he said.More surveyed banks are reporting tightening standards than less restrictive ones, though the gap has expanded only modestly, Mr. Levkovich said. Whether it keeps widening, seriously jeopardizing the economy, may depend on what the Fed does about interest rates. A cut in its target for the federal funds rate, which banks charge one another on very short-term loans, is essential, he said.“A fall in employment is unlikely to happen immediately, but it will happen eventually if the Fed doesn’t respond to the messy credit conditions,” he warned. “Trimming the Fed funds rate should add liquidity and fend off the tightening of lending standards, but there are no guarantees, of course.”DATA WATCHIn recent statements, Fed officials have played down the threat of inflation. Two bits of data this week are expected to confirm their assessment.The Bloomberg poll forecasts that a revision on Thursday in the second-quarter productivity report will show labor costs rising 1.6 percent, annualized, after the preliminary 2.1 percent announced last month.A modest decline is foreseen on Tuesday in the Institute for Supply Management survey of manufacturing conditions. A reading of 53.0 is expected for August, versus 53.8 for July. A bigger drop, to 63.0 from 65.0, is seen in the survey component indicating prices paid by manufacturers for parts and raw materials."
15,"Maple Heights, OhioTAMMI and Charles Eggleston never took out a risky mortgage, never borrowed more than they could afford and never missed a monthly payment on their neat, three-bedroom colonial in the Cleveland suburbs. But that hasn’t prevented them from getting caught in the undertow of the subprime mortgage mess now submerging this town.Over the last 18 months, the Egglestons have watched one house after another on their street, Gardenview Drive, end up foreclosed and vacant. Although lawns are still tidy and empty homes are not boarded up and stripped as they are in inner-city Cleveland, the Egglestons say Maple Heights no longer feels safe after dark. Nor do they have the confidence they had when they moved in a decade ago that this is the ideal place to raise their 6-year-old twin girls, Sydney and Shelby. So, in May 2006, they put their home on the market in order to move closer to Mrs. Eggleston’s parents in another middle-class Cleveland suburb, Richmond Heights.They have had no takers. Although they lowered the asking price to $99,000 from $109,000, no one has even come to look at it in more than six weeks. “My heart panics every time I drive down the street and I see another for-sale sign,” says Mrs. Eggleston, pointing past the placards in front of her porch to others that dot surrounding yards like lawn furniture. “Some people on the street couldn’t pay, so they just left. The competition to sell is just ridiculous.”It is a scene being repeated in cities and towns across America as loans that were made to borrowers with little or no credit history, many of whom could not even afford a down payment, fail in ever-growing numbers. It is also a story of how local economic trends are intersecting with national politics, with local foreclosures drawing the attention of Democratic presidential candidates, including John Edwards and Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio.On the Republican side, President Bush announced on Friday several steps aimed at alleviating the impact of the subprime crisis on homeowners. In a Rose Garden appearance, he ruled out a federal bailout, citing both “excesses in the lending industry” and unduly optimistic homeowners who took out “loans larger than they could afford,” as reasons for the mortgage woes.Indeed, what was once a problem confined mostly to economically struggling areas is quickly becoming a national phenomenon. Last year, there were 1.2 million foreclosure filings in the United States, up 42 percent from 2005, according to RealtyTrac, a firm that analyzes such data. At current rates so far this year, RealtyTrac expects foreclosure filings to hit two million in 2007, or roughly one per 62 American households — a rate approaching heights not seen since the Great Depression.Analysts also say that the fallout from mortgages gone bad is spreading well beyond borrowers now in default. It has begun to engulf middle-class communities like Maple Heights, where nearly 10 percent of the houses — or 910 properties — have been seized by banks in the last two years. And it foreshadows what could lie in store if mortgage holders default on what the Federal Reserve conservatively estimates to be $100 billion in risky subprime loans. Many of these loans were made in 2005 and early 2006, when standards were at their most lax and cities like this were blanketed with aggressive pitches from mortgage providers.“I don’t think we’ve hit bottom,” says Michael G. Ciaravino, the mayor of Maple Heights. “My fear is that foreclosure rates could go to double where they are today.”IN terms of the subprime mortgage meltdown, Ohio has been among the hardest-hit states, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. In Cuyahoga County, which includes Cleveland and surrounding suburbs, roughly 30 percent of subprime mortgages are either delinquent or in foreclosure, says Jim Rokakis, the county treasurer.But this leafy community of bungalows and small family homes built after World War II could be described as its epicenter. Already, Maple Heights, with a population of 27,000, ranks No. 1 in Cuyahoga County in foreclosures per capita, according to Policy Matters Ohio, a nonprofit research group. Ranked by ZIP code, the number of foreclosures here puts Maple Heights in the top one-half of 1 percent nationally, RealtyTrac says.Mayor Ciaravino has already had to shut his town’s two swimming pools, cut the ranks of police officers and firefighters and eliminate services like free plowing for senior citizens with snow-covered driveways.With so many houses vacant, says Michael H. Slocum, the finance director of Maple Heights, “it puts a big question mark out there; historical collection patterns for taxes are becoming less reliable.”In fact, when the town made its annual assessment on homes for garbage collection last month, receipts came in 15 percent below projections, forcing a 50 percent rate increase.“There is truly a cascading effect,” says Mr. Ciaravino, 43, who grew up in Maple Heights and was a local prosecutor before being elected mayor four years ago. Sitting in his 1950s-style wood-paneled office in City Hall, he says that “the folks living next to these empty homes get discouraged, and middle-class people are leaving.”For a mayor presiding over a town in crisis, Mr. Ciaravino doesn’t seem angry, but beneath an affable exterior is barely concealed frustration that the danger of subprime debt became a national issue only after Wall Street began to wake up to the threat this summer. “We’ve been warning of problems for years,” he says. “I’m just a small-town mayor. Where was the foresight?”That same question is echoing among politicians with constituencies far larger than Mr. Ciaravino’s. In July, Mr. Edwards came to Cleveland to tour a neighborhood hammered by foreclosures. Two months earlier, Mr. Kucinich took reporters on a walking tour of the neighborhood where he spent part of his childhood, Slavic Village, pointing out boarded homes and criticizing what he called “predatory lenders.”What’s more, Cleveland is key in a crucial battleground state in the next presidential election, so it is a good bet that more candidates from both parties will be here touring neighborhoods dotted with foreclosed homes, much the way Ronald Reagan went to the South Bronx in 1980 to highlight what he called the failure of Jimmy Carter’s economic policies.“There’s plenty of blame to go around,” warns Mr. Ciaravino.TWICE a week, the East Side Organizing Project, an advocacy group in an industrial neighborhood midway between downtown Cleveland and Maple Heights, is host to what its executive director, Mark Seifert, calls “the cattle call.” The group helps mortgage holders keep their homes, and these afternoon sessions are when new clients first go over their cases.Until this year, he says, about 80 percent of the people who came for help lived in the city, with the balance from close-in suburbs like Maple Heights. Today, the mix is split evenly between city and suburb.So, in a windowless conference room in late August, as ceiling fans buzz overhead, James Jones, an intake specialist, tells newcomers: “We’re in the business of trying to save your home. The information we get from you is what we use to negotiate.”The group uses other resources, too — like a bit of street theater to coax recalcitrant banks into renegotiating loans going sour. Mr. Seifert and his colleagues have scattered plastic sharks on the lawns of regional Countrywide Financial Corporation managers, and organized protests outside their offices. “We have cellphone numbers of the folks in the ivory tower making decisions, and we can call them at 1 a.m.,” Mr. Jones promises the group.It usually doesn’t come to that. The project holds conference calls with Countrywide, CitiFinancial and others, mediating between the lender and individual mortgage holders. In successful renegotiations — which happen in about 85 percent of the cases the project handles — Mr. Seifert and his team persuade lenders to accept lower interest rates, or even a reduction in the total value of the loan, instead of foreclosing.Lenders have incentives to negotiate. In addition to the plastic sharks and bad publicity, Mr. Seifert says, they can avoid the loss that comes with the seizure of a property. “Let’s say the loan is for $100,000,” he explains. “The banks know that if the house ends up getting foreclosed, they’ll only walk away with $50,000 or $60,000.”If foreclosures ultimately harm underlying property values and cause losses to both lender and borrower, why are they still so prevalent?“Some lenders understand; others don’t,” Mr. Seifert says. “Countrywide doesn’t.” Out of 120 recent mortgages cases with Countrywide, Mr. Seifert says, 15 have resulted in work-out deals, only two of which he said were “very good.”One of those loans belonged to Audrey Sweet, a Maple Heights resident and a first-time home buyer who borrowed $118,000 from Countrywide in late 2004 without putting any money down. Because of Mrs. Sweet’s poor credit history and lack of assets, the adjustable loan’s rate was 10.25 percent, but she says she was told that if the couple “just proved themselves,” they could quickly refinance at a lower rate.Mrs. Sweet says Countrywide advised her that the monthly property tax bill would be $100, but it turned out to be $230 and the Sweets quickly fell behind. Countrywide stepped in and paid $3,493 in back taxes in March 2007, and the next month raised the Sweets’ monthly mortgage bill to $1,713 from $1,055.That was far beyond the budget of the couple, so Mrs. Sweet turned to the East Side group in April. She says Countrywide finally budged in late July, the day before she testified before Congress at a Joint Economic Committee hearing about her experiences with Countrywide. Working with a local lender, Third Federal Savings and Loan, the Sweets managed to refinance the loan at a fixed rate of 7.2 percent, and the original $1,055 monthly payment now covers the property taxes the Sweets couldn’t afford before.Countrywide says it has tried to work with East Side but “has been met with nothing but derision and grandstanding,” adding that it does not believe “these efforts help to save anyone’s home from foreclosure.” Nationally, Countrywide has completed 35,000 successful renegotiations so far this year, including 50 in Cleveland in a two-day period last week, according to Rick Simon, a Countrywide spokesman.“We have made a tremendous effort to avoid foreclosures and work with customers,” he says.It is also clear that the Sweets bear some responsibility for their predicament. “I do blame myself a little bit,” Mrs. Sweet acknowledges. “I feel dumb.” She explains that she was focused on the monthly payment when she borrowed from Countrywide, not the interest rate or taxes due. “Once we got the loan documents at the closing, I just came home and stuck them in a drawer.”Although the Sweets’ story has a happy ending, some neighbors have not been nearly as lucky. Three houses on their street have gone through foreclosure, including one home three doors down, where their neighbor’s possessions were dumped onto the lawn. “And I live on the better end of town,” Mrs. Sweet says.AS he drives through the Slavic Village neighborhood, passing homes stripped of aluminum siding, copper pipes and other remnants, Marc A. Stefanski says, “There are still S.& L.’s and banks that lend with a conscience, but, man, you got to find them.”Mr. Stefanski should know: as the chief executive of Third Federal Savings and Loan, a Cleveland thrift that his parents founded in 1938, he has an unusual perspective on the mortgage mess. Unlike most of his competitors, Mr. Stefanski resisted the urge to cash in on the subprime lending boom.His bank never offered no-money-down loans, piggyback mortgages, exploding adjustable-rate mortgages or the other financial exotica that ultimately tripped up the Sweets and millions like them. Third Federal pays its loan officers salaries, rather than commissions, so there is no incentive to go for volume. Even more remarkable is that Third Federal holds onto a sizable portion of its mortgages and keeps them on the books, rather than selling them to Wall Street to be sliced and diced into asset-backed securities owned by investors on the other side of the globe.The result is that unlike many other mortgage lenders, Third Federal has a vested interest in making sure its loans do not go bad, so foreclosure is a last resort.“The model has shifted,” says Mr. Stefanski. “It became very lucrative. But it was totally irresponsible for the sake of greed.” Not that Mr. Stefanski didn’t notice the profits to be had. “Absolutely, we were tempted,” he acknowledges. “We arm-wrestled and talked, but we decided not to change the model. We felt it wasn’t the right thing to do.”Mr. Stefanski is no social worker. He lives in an affluent suburb of Cleveland and earned nearly $2 million last year. But he does not hide his feelings about just what went wrong in places like Maple Heights. “The whole system was based on raping the public,” he says, matter-of-factly. “Not everyone should own a home — just those who can afford it.”Third Federal has a branch in Maple Heights, Mr. Stefanski says, and in the past, “we owned Maple Heights.” But in recent years, he says, “The predators just jumped on it.”Third Federal’s share of the mortgage market in northeastern Ohio fell to a low of about 11 percent by 2001 from more than 30 percent in the early 1990s.Tammi Eggleston also watched the more aggressive lenders move in, albeit from a different vantage point. “They were canvassing the neighborhood,” she recalls. “Letters in the mail, knocking on the door, calling on the phone. They were everywhere.”Now, with other lenders pulling back and some fighting to stay in business, Third Federal has increased its share of the mortgage market to 24 percent, picking up mortgages like that of the Sweets and earning praise from community activists like Mr. Seifert. Perhaps even more significantly, Third Federal has created a program for more risky borrowers like the Sweets, with required classes so that mortgage holders understand exactly how their loans work and what they will owe.WHY has the impact of the subprime meltdown been so much more severe in communities like Maple Heights than in other parts of the country? Mr. Rokakis suggests that it is a combination of Cleveland’s underlying economic problems and a lack of the steadily appreciating housing prices that other areas enjoyed. That shut off a crucial safety valve — in other regions, overwhelmed borrowers could often turn around and sell their homes for at least a slight profit.In Maple Heights, the situation is now reversed: with so many properties on the market, home values are dropping, and some delinquent mortgage holders owe more than their homes could now fetch in a sale. “The tax base is eroding,” says Mr. Ciaravino, the mayor. He warns that property values may soon have to be reassessed downward, further crimping tax revenue and raising the heat on Maple Heights’ remaining property owners. “This has affected virtually every aspect of community life, like increasing the rate of transient students in the schools,” he says.All of these factors are reasons the Egglestons want to move, but they are not sure they will be able to do so anytime soon. “We’re torn,” says Mrs. Eggleston, who works as an executive assistant at a Cleveland nonprofit organization. “You can see and feel the change in the neighborhood. We’re really not sure what to do.”Mr. Ciaravino is torn, too. He understands the Egglestons’ fears but needs middle-class families like them to stay if Maple Heights is to have a decent future. “We’re not giving up the fight here,” he says, with a trace of weariness in his voice. “It’s frustrating because this could have been avoided. We as a nation are capable of much better than this.”"
16,"WHEN it comes to their investments, many Americans associate the word “foreign” with high risk. Advisers routinely recommend that foreign holdings amount to no more than 10 or 20 percent of a stock portfolio. Otherwise, the theory goes, investors risk heavy losses in the event of a foreign crisis, like the Asian financial upheaval of the 1990s.But the latest round of world financial problems started at home, in the United States, as a result of the subprime mortgage crisis. This time, the United States has exported volatility to the rest of the world. At least that’s the argument of some financial experts, who say that individual investors should not necessarily look at the United States as a haven. Instead, they say that investors should hold a substantial percentage of their portfolios in non-American companies, through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.“If the recent volatility in the United States is what scares you into doing the right thing, great,” says Uri Landesman, head of global growth and international at ING Americas, a subsidiary of the Dutch bank. “But it’s what you should have been doing all along.”Mr. Landesman, who is based in New York and oversees about $4.3 billion in investments, is keen on investing in Britain, but not Continental Europe or Japan. And he is enthusiastic about technology companies in Taiwan, where he has invested 5 to 6 percent of the portfolio he oversees. He urges caution in investing in places like Thailand or Turkey, which have been facing possible political crises. Mr. Landesman contends that individual investors should have 40 to 50 percent of their stock portfolios in international investments. “Buy a fund that owns non-U.S. stocks that does its own allocation,” he says. “You can also buy an E.T.F. in a particular country or a fund in a particular country.”He says he does not believe that individuals should try to buy foreign equities by themselves. “Most people do not want to watch a screen all day,” he says.Vanguard, the mutual fund group, says that only about 11 percent of the typical 401(k) retirement plan is invested in international equities. Ellen Rinaldi, principal for investment counseling and research at Vanguard in Malvern, Pa., cautions that investors should not make rash moves just because of domestic market volatility, but adds that it makes sense for average investors to have 20 percent of their holdings in non-American stock funds.“Moving to 20 percent would be a significant increase and a good diversification,” Ms. Rinaldi says.But it does not make sense, in her view, for investors to go beyond about 30 percent. “As you move up, and if you go over 30 percent, you’re taking on additional risk and expense, so you’re not getting as much diversification benefit,” she says. Her firm offers a variety of international mutual funds like Total International, Pacific, Emerging Markets and Developed Markets. Emerging markets have traditionally been viewed as the riskiest in the world, but over the past several years, they have attracted a flood of capital and have performed strongly. “These aren’t your father’s emerging markets,” says Arthur P. Steinmetz, who manages $20 billion in assets at OppenheimerFunds, $5 billion of which is invested in emerging markets.Mr. Steinmetz, based in New York, says that most emerging markets are far more sophisticated and stable than they were 10 years ago, when the Asian financial crisis hit. He notes that Brazil, for example, has $160 billion in foreign exchange reserves and that its foreign debt, once an issue of concern, has shrunk dramatically. It is much better able to withstand volatility. “The sandbags that Brazil has around it against global flooding are much higher than they used to be,” he says.Although Mr. Steinmetz says that now is a good time to buy emerging-market equities, Antoine van Agtmael, head of Emerging Markets Management in Arlington, Va., says that recent run-ups in their share prices mean that investors should wait.“Emerging markets are fully priced,” says Mr. van Agtmael, whose firm manages a family of funds with more than $20 billion in emerging-market investments. “You don’t want to go into these markets after they’ve had a big run.”He says he is convinced that emerging markets are a good bet over the next five years, just not in coming months.Although Mr. Steinmetz and Mr. van Agtmael may differ over timing, they share the view that further expected declines in the value of the dollar and other macroeconomic adjustments needed to reduce American borrowing in the world make investing in foreign securities increasingly important. “I would argue that having exposure to international securities denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar is a useful hedge,” Mr. Steinmetz says. “Investors will have an asset that is appreciating,” he said, even if the value of United States-based assets declines.Mr. van Agtmael, the author of “The Emerging Markets Century,” is credited with coining the term “emerging markets” in the early 1980s. He argues that structural changes in emerging markets mean that they are stable enough for average American investors.One such change is the investment opportunity offered by big infrastructure projects. “Emerging markets now invest more in infrastructure than the United States,” he says, citing the recent steam-pipe explosion in Manhattan and the bridge collapse in Minneapolis. “That was not true just a couple of years ago. Their investments are going up at a rate of about 20 percent while ours has been growing at about 5 to 6 percent.”Although the American market is traditionally regarded as being so vast and deep that it is more stable than emerging countries’ markets, those countries have made big strides in managing their foreign exchange reserves, current account deficits and currency positions. “They’ve learned their lessons,” Mr. van Agtmael says. “Their economic policies have become a lot sounder than they were before and they have a hell of a lot more money.”Mr. van Agtmael is clearly more aggressive about emerging markets than many other investment professionals and argues that if emerging markets represent 23 percent of the world economy, investors should have at least 20 percent of their portfolios in these markets. “That’s neutral,” he says.And he has profited from his convictions: his fund has gained more than 30 percent in value over each of the past three years.PATRICK DORSEY, the director of equity research at Morningstar in Chicago, which rates mutual funds, says there is no one international investment percentage that all investors should embrace. “It depends on age, risk tolerance and a whole list of factors,” Mr. Dorsey says.But he agrees with money managers that Americans are “overinvested” in their home market. “It’s a familiarity bias,” he says. “But it may very well be that our home market is the riskiest. It’s a mistake for investors to always think that foreign investments are always riskier.”"

18,"LONDON —The market fallout from the subprime mortgage slump is less severe than in 1998 after Russia's default and the collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, the Bank for International Settlements said Monday.The assessment from the international bank, which monitors financial markets for central banks and regulates lenders, contrasts with an analysis from Standard & Poor's, which said last week that the outlook for securities firms was worse than in 1998.""Some investors began to draw parallels with the autumn of 1998, when the collapse of LTCM had triggered fears of instability in the banking system as a whole,"" the bank, based in Basel, Switzerland, said in a report. ""However, the recent rise in U.S. 10-year swap spreads was less sharp than at the time of the LTCM crisis.""Investors are demanding a yield premium over 10-year Treasury notes of 70 basis points to swap floating interest rate payments for fixed, up from 54 basis points in May. In 1998, the premium, which increases as the perception of risk deteriorates, had more than doubled to 97 basis points.Bank stocks dropped as much 17 percent this year, half the 35 percent decline in 1998, according to the Standard & Poor's Banks Index.Declines in stock markets ""largely reflected investors' anticipation of losses related to speculation in the subprime market and other credit products, as well as expected declines in bank profits due to lower M&A-generated fees,"" the BIS said. ""Despite such losses, the overall decline amongst U.S. banks had not by late August been as severe as in 1998.""S&P, based in New York, said last week that revenue from investment banking and trading might fall 47 percent in the final six months, compared with a 31 percent decline nine years ago.

19,"BERLIN —IKB Deutsche Industriebank, the German bank that is being bailed out after being hurt by its investments in U.S. subprime loans, said Monday that it would post a loss of as much as €700 million this fiscal year.IKB said in a statement that its board was convinced that a one-time ""balance sheet adjustment is required for a successful fresh start.""The announcement came as a report by Fitch Ratings said that European banks were revealing little about their exposure as the U.S. subprime crisis unfolds. China said that none of its massive foreign exchange stockpile was invested in the U.S. subprime mortgage sector.IKB will curtail investments in international securities funded by commercial paper and expects future earnings will be ""significantly lower"" than in previous years, its newly installed chief executive, Günther Braeunig, said.Profit at the company amounted to €179.6 million, or $244.6 million, in the 12 months ended March 31. For the fiscal year 2007 it forecast a loss of €600 million to €700 million.The German state bank, KfW, and German banking associations agreed to cover some losses at IKB after rising defaults on U.S. home loans to people with patchy credit histories drove down the value of mortgage-backed securities.The bank replaced the chief executive, Stefan Ortseifen, and the chief financial officer, Volker Doberanzke, with managers from KfW, which owns 38 percent of IKB.German prosecutors have opened an investigation into Ortseifen and other officials on suspicion of breach of trust and possible violations of corporate law.""We knew it would cost a lot of money so this didn't come as a shock,"" said Johannes Thormann, an analyst at WestLB in Düsseldorf.IKB shares declined 21 cents, or 1.49 percent, to €13.88 in Frankfurt. The stock has fallen by almost half since the end of June, leaving the company with a market value of €1.22 billion.Fitch Ratings said that the reluctance to tell all about subprime exposure might itself be feeding nervousness in markets about who holds what risks, one of the underlying reasons for liquidity seizing up in the first place.""One of the marked features of the current circumstances is the opacity of information,"" Fitch said in a report published Friday. ""Without a better understanding of where the risks currently lie, many market participants are simply standing on the sidelines.""In Beijing, a senior Chinese foreign exchange agency official said that none of China's $1.33 trillion in foreign exchange reserves - the world's largest - was in U.S. subprime mortgage-backed securities, underscoring China's earlier assertions that it had only limited exposure.""We have no holdings of U.S. subprime securities,"" said Wei Benhua, deputy head of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.As part of the reorganization, Braeunig said that IKB would focus on German corporate banking, leasing and private equity, as well as structured finance and real estate financing.""The board is convinced that this is the right action at the right time,"" Braeunig said. ""There is no alternative than to take a deep cut and clear risks.""The bank will publish earnings for the quarter ended June 30 after a special audit by PriceWaterhouseCoopers. The results are expected at the end of this month, Braeunig said.The European economy will sustain its expansion, riding out the credit-market turbulence that has roiled financial markets, the European Union economic and monetary affairs commissioner, Joaquín Almunia, said Monday, Bloomberg News reported from Madrid.""I think the growth forecast will be maintained within a decimal point either way,"" Almunia said.

20,"HONG KONG, Sept. 3  Private equity firms are setting records in the size of Asian buyout funds, adding to an existing pool of more than $35 billion that is waiting to be invested in deals in the region, industry participants and analysts said.The aggressive fund-raising drive in Asianwide and country-specific buyout funds is taking place at a time of tightening credit markets, volatility in equity markets and some resistance from shareholders and regulators to private equity buyouts.Analysts said this mix of conditions posed new challenges for private equity firms in replicating the deals on which they built their reputations of strong returns to investors.But led by several global buyout funds, investors are expected to commit $25 billion more in the second half of this year to private equity funds in Asia, according to the Center for Asia Private Equity Research. That would be on top of $15.4 billion in fresh capital committed to regional funds in the first half of 2007, a rise of 57 percent over the period a year earlier.In recent months, big private equity firms have been leapfrogging one another to set records for fund size. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts this year built a $4 billion Asia fund; TPG, formerly the Texas Pacific Group, is expected to close in the coming weeks on an Asia fund of about $4.2 billion; and CVC Capital Partners has built one that could reach $5 billion.Even at such sizes, the Asian funds are still well below levels set by buyout funds in more mature markets like Europe, where Kohlberg Kravis, for example, is seeking to raise a fund of at least 7.7 billion euros, or $10.4 billion.“There is so much international capital looking to find a home in private equity generally, and Asia is regarded as particularly attractive at the moment,” said Andy Thomson, editor of Private Equity International, a magazine in London.Asian markets, on the back of strong economic growth, have performed better in recent years, and big investors are increasingly interested in diversifying from traditional regions like Europe and North America.But other analysts said the growth of this Asian private equity war chest coincided with increasing difficulties for the industry in completing big-ticket deals, even before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States put a squeeze on credit markets and brought volatility to stock markets.The Center for Asia Private Equity Research has tracked a marked increase in the number and dollar size of deal failures since the start of the year. From January to the end of July, it said 22 deals, valued at $38.9 billion, had failed because of regulatory hurdles or because shareholders of target companies had rejected the price.Australia, which has been one of the leading markets in the region for private equity deals during the last two years, has also led the way in prominent failures, including the collapse of the proposed buyout of Qantas Airways.In several deals in Australia, private equity buyers were either outbid by strategic investors or shareholders were unwilling to accept the valuations. Elsewhere in the region, regulatory hurdles are often the bigger problem for the industry.Kathleen Ng, managing director of the center, said private equity firms in Asia would have to seek more deals in the hundreds of millions, rather than billions, of dollars and be satisfied with minority positions in companies instead of buyouts.In the meantime, there is a lot more money chasing deals in the region. Ms. Ng estimated that the current value of unallocated funds in Asia was $35.7 billion at the end of July, with the amount set to grow sharply.“It’s a testing time,” she said. “But private equity investors are very innovative. They find a way to devise a deal.”Although the recent market problems have added to the complications, Ms. Ng said there was intense demand from investors in private equity funds, like pension funds and insurance companies, that have long-term investment horizons.Market volatility may also foster more deals. If the recent market problems start to affect the broad economy, analysts and industry participants said, there could be a return to some of the bargain-hunting that benefited private equity firms in the early part of the decade.“Periods of volatility are normal in Asia,” said Dan Carroll, a senior partner with TPG in Hong Kong. “And it is in times of volatility that we have done our better deals.”He said TPG’s deal pipeline remained “very active,” and he expressed confidence that the firm would be to able fully allocate its latest fund-raising.A lot of the new deals are likely to be in China, while Australia could slip, which would be a significant change.According to figures released by Thomson Financial last month, Australia topped the region, excluding Japan, for private equity deals in the first half of the year, with $12.3 billion in deal value. China ranked sixth, with deals worth $678.7 million completed.“Australia had an outsized year in 2006, going into 2007 well above the historical mean, and that is correcting a bit,” Mr. Carroll said. “China and Japan will be increasingly active markets in the next couple of years.”"
21,"MOSCOW —Standing just across the river from the Kremlin, Rosneft's headquarters lies shrouded in scaffolding.The building's upgrade reflects the changes within as Rosneft acclimatizes to its new status as the country's largest oil company, following its purchase earlier this year of the remaining fields and production units that once belonged to bankrupt oil firm Yukos.The shopping spree lifted its production to more than two million barrels per day, but also left the company heavily in debt, potentially affecting its capacity to undertake future projects as it approaches a debt market reeling from the global liquidity crunch.""The markets have been difficult,"" Peter O'Brien, Rosneft's vice president for finance, said in a recent interview in his second-floor office, as yet untouched by the renovation work.Rosneft's attempt to pay down part of its $25 billion debt to financial institutions through a $5 billion bond issue failed in July, postponed just after the completion of an international roadshow because of market volatility.""When we went out, it was the start of it,"" O'Brien said, referring to the instability that shook global markets as the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis began to bite. ""It's been very difficult, and it's starting to look a little bit better now.""Gazprom, state-owned but laden with more than $40 billion in debt, also postponed a bond sale in its Gaz Capital unit in August amid market jitters.The lack of cash in international markets has in part prompted Rosneft to look closer to home, opting to issue ruble-denominated bonds by the end of the year, O'Brien said.The issue, rumored to be for 45 billion rubles, or $1.76 billion, has yet to be approved by the company's board.""These market conditions are bad and they're not that desperate,"" said Al Breach, the chief strategist at UBS, referring to Rosneft. ""Now they have to look for other sources of funding. Going local will partially enable that.""""They're a very singular case, with sponsorship from the state that has helped them be able to raise capital,"" Breach said.Rosneft raised $11 billion through an initial public offering in July 2006, reducing the state's share to 75.16 percent. The company has no plans to issue additional shares anytime soon, O'Brien said.Rosneft aims to have a ratio of debt to EBITDA - earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization - of one to one by the end of 2010.The company spent more than $25 billion acquiring Yukos assets in a round of bankruptcy auctions this year that effectively dismantled what was once the country's largest oil company. It took huge loans from a consortium of Western banks to cover the cost.But with Yukos's court-appointed receiver declaring Rosneft the bankrupt firm's largest creditor after the Federal Tax Service, it also recouped about $11 billion from the auction proceeds .It also retrieved a 9.44 percent stake that Yukos had held in the firm, which, at Rosneft's current $80 billion market capitalization, is worth around $8 billion.O'Brien said Rosneft would likely use most of the stake to fund further mergers and acquisitions, saving some of it to pay off more debt, potentially in the form of convertible bonds.O'Brien denied recently revived speculation that Rosneft was seeking to take over Surgutneftegaz, the country's fourth largest oil producer, which is estimated to be sitting on $16 billion in cash.""It's not being discussed,"" he said.Some analysts have speculated that the Kremlin-friendly oligarch Oleg Deripaska was roped in by the state to buy the country's seventh-largest oil producer, Russneft, which is currently struggling under the weight of hundreds of millions of dollars in tax claims. Its former president, Mikhail Gutseriyev, was recently placed on an Interpol wanted list after fleeing the country to escape what he has called politically motivated charges against him.The campaign against Gutseriyev and Russneft has prompted comparisons with Yukos, which was felled by over $30 billion in back tax claims and the jailing of its founder, Mikhail Khodorkovsky.Khodorkovsky accused Igor Sechin, Putin's deputy chief of staff and chairman of Rosneft's board, of orchestrating the campaign against him.Rosneft has now gobbled up the lion's share of Yukos's assets, growing from a middling oil concern into the country's largest oil company mainly through its purchase of Yukos's largest production units, Yuganskneftegaz, Tomskneft and Samaraneftegaz. Absorbing those acquisitions will take up much of Rosneft's attention as it prepares to go global and challenge the likes of Shell and BP.""It's clear to us that we need to spend the next year or two focusing on successfully integrating recent acquisitions and improving efficiency,"" O'Brien said.""We expect Russia next year to move to a more proactive state phase - out of the acquisitions phase and into the exploration phase. The state companies will be leading that,"" said Chris Weafer, chief strategist at UralSib. ""Rosneft is going to have to raise a lot more cash."""
22,"FRANKFURT —The head of Deutsche Bank acknowledged Tuesday that the bank, the largest listed one in Germany, had taken a hit from the recent wave of volatility in global financial markets. But he said the outlook for the industry was improving amid signs that liquidity was returning, a remark that lifted shares of European banks.""I am optimistic about the environment globally for financial institutions,"" Josef Ackermann, the chief executive, said during a banking conference.The turbulence in world stock markets, set off by rising delinquencies among risky U.S. mortgages, will leave its mark on the banking industry, said Ackermann, who cautioned that his bank was ""inevitably affected"" in sales trading and corporate finance.""It may take some time for the financial system to digest the effects of the subprime crisis,"" Ackermann said. ""Without doubt,"" he added, ""some 'blocked' transactions will take some time to work through.""But the nervous psychology that gripped investors in August appears to be settling, he said.Ackerman added that he remained ""pleased"" with the performance of Deutsche Bank's consumer-banking and money-management units last month. The bank faced no liquidity problems during the market volatility, and was not exposed to a further deterioration in U.S. subprime mortgages, he said.Ackermann's view was shared by the head of the German savings bank association DSGV, who said during the conference that the market now appeared to be secure and stable.""The crisis of confidence is gradually diminishing and we are increasingly returning to normal operations,"" Heinrich Haasis, the head of DSGV, said. ""The problem was not so much to do with subprime, but rather banks' lack of trust in one another.""Germany has been home to some of the most high-profile victims of the subprime crisis in Europe. Two German lenders, IKB Deutsche Industriebank and Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, known as SachsenLB, required rescues after investments linked to that market turned sour, and several more have detailed billions of euros in exposure to U.S. subprime assets.The crisis has reverberated throughout the financial sector, prompting banks to curb lending to one other and forcing central banks to step in to provide extra liquidity. But Haasis said that with the rescues of the two banks, the main problems faced by the German financial sector had been resolved.Deutsche Bank had pointed out the problems at IKB to German regulators at the beginning of the crisis, Ackermann said.Keeping quiet would have done more damage to the German banking market, Ackermann said. He also said companies should learn from the turbulence not to invest in assets and markets they do not understand. Deutsche Bank's own credit risk, he said, is ""well-controlled.""Peer Steinbrück, the German finance minister, said the credit problems and near failure of IKB and SachsenLB had been a ""serious crisis"" but that the Germany financial system had sufficient reserves to overcome the problems, and that they would not slow the Germany economy.Deutsche Bank is aiming to raise pretax profit excluding one-time gains and costs to €8.4 billion, or $11.4 billion, in 2008 by expanding what Ackermann has called ""stable"" businesses to help compensate for swings in investment-banking revenue. The bank had pretax profit of €5.86 billion in the first half of the year, of which about 18 percent came from the private clients and asset management division.The bank gets about half its revenue from sales and trading, and last month it described market conditions as ""very challenging."" UBS analysts cut their 2008 earnings estimates for European banks including Deutsche Bank by 5 percent Tuesday, citing the rout in the credit markets prompted by rising U.S. subprime mortgage defaults.Deutsche Bank has also made promises of loans to buyout companies valued at €29 billion and so-called equity bridges of €750 million, Ackermann said. The company warned last month that revenue from leveraged finance would drop because of increasing aversion to risk.Bank regulators in the United States urged mortgage lenders Tuesday to ease terms on the subprime loans they packaged into bonds, seeking to stem foreclosures that may aggravate what is already the worst U.S. housing slump in 16 years, Bloomberg News reported from Washington.The Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking regulators asked lenders to review their authority under pooling and servicing agreements to identify borrowers at risk of default and offer to refinance to help them keep their homes.The regulators' recommendation is part of a broader push by the federal government to stem the growing rate of foreclosures among borrowers with weak credit or high debt and to quell the recent turmoil in the credit markets.Last week, President George W. Bush unveiled a plan to help homeowners avoid foreclosure, including an initiative that would allow the Federal Housing Administration to help borrowers facing rising mortgage payments stay in their homes."
23,"PARIS —In Europe, August is a cherished vacation month on the financial calendar, leading to erratic trading and volatile markets.So when markets entered an exceptionally rocky period following the collapse of two Bear Stearns funds with exposure to bad U.S. mortgage loans, many investors and bankers just stepped back to monitor the markets and wait until September, when the extent of companies' exposure to the crisis was clearer.But now that the summer vacations are over, the only thing that seems certain is that insecurity over where possible credit losses may lie persists.""We are at an inflection point,"" said Puneet Sharma, a credit analyst at Barclays Capital in London. ""Confidence among short-term investors needs to be restored first and they are waiting to hear what the central banks say, what earnings the big brokerages report and how the Fed reacts. There is no doubt that downside market risks prevail.""Investors are waiting for the big Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to start reporting earnings in two weeks to see how big the damage really is.European banks, including UniCredit, have published statements saying their exposure to subprime loans is negligible. But mistrust persists among investors because some analysts and rating agencies have said it is impossible to estimate losses as a result of the U.S. subprime lending crisis.Loans to U.S. customers with poor credit histories have started to appear in the form of complex debt structures on banks' balance sheets or in funds managed by them and hedge funds from Europe to Australia. This has prompted writedowns, bailouts and fund closings.Spooked by more possible fallout from the subprime crisis, some investors have started to unwind their investments, trying to retrieve their money while they still can, and that has led to a slump in stock prices. Few investors were courageous enough to buy even though some analysts pointed to bargains, with some investors likening such an act to attempting to catch a falling knife.Insecurity about market valuations has exacerbated the downward trend, in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average has fallen 2.4 percent since June 15, when reports emerged that Bear Stearns would liquidate holdings from one of its hedge funds after making unprofitable bets on subprime mortgage bonds.On Wednesday, most markets across Asia, Europe and the United States fell.The method of splicing up risky debt, like subprime loans, and repackaging it into less-risky but highly complex debt investment vehicles, like collateralized debt obligations, makes it almost impossible to determine the exposure of companies to the recent market turmoil, analysts say.""We are not in a trend-following pattern at the moment, and even although companies are updating the market and banks feel there is a necessity to be open it is very difficult to evaluate anything,"" said Derek Chambers, a banking analyst at Standard & Poor's Equity Research in London.For the big Wall Street firms, some analysts say the pain will be felt most in fixed-income divisions and at those banks with a heavy exposure to mortgages. The exceptionally successful trading month of July may ease the damage on the quarterly figures.But analysts at Lehman Brothers Holdings wrote in a report Wednesday that European investment banks would take a ""material hit"" to earnings from losses incurred by activities related to U.S. subprime loans. They said that disclosure by those banks about their subprime-related assets, including collateralized debt obligations, ""ranges from the bad to the nonexistent.""Some executives at European banks tried to calm investors before the reporting period by saying that there were signs the credit markets were coming back. Josef Ackermann, Deutsche Bank's chief executive, acknowledged Tuesday that Deutsche Bank's investment banking business had been hit by the recent turmoil in credit markets, but he said that liquidity was returning and that he was satisfied with the bank's overall performance.The increasing caution has meant that investors have shied away from anything remotely related to securities backed by assets like mortgages, nearly shutting down the market for leveraged lending, which relies heavily on credit markets.Such leveraged lending is employed heavily by private equity firms to finance takeover deals. But without any buyers for such debt products, they are having difficulty raising cash for future takeovers. That is bound to hurt investment banks like Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse that have relied heavily on lucrative contracts to advise on and help finance private equity buyouts.Wendel, the Paris-listed investment company, said recently that given the current market conditions it would not do any buyouts for the next six months, according to Bloomberg News.Investment banks earn about a quarter of their advisory fees from private equity buyouts, according to some bankers. Business from private equity clients has completely dried up, said a senior banker at a large American investment bank in London.There is little hope that this will dramatically improve anytime soon and banks will be cautious in lending for several years, said Roger Nightingale, global economist at Millennium Global Investments in London.""Not until those guilty of the grossest ineptitude have been promoted out of harm's way will lending policies become adventurous again,"" he said.Some investment bankers hope that the limits placed on leveraged buyouts will lure corporations back into the mergers and acquisitions market after a period in which many were priced out by high-powered and aggressive buyout firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Permira. But as nervousness in the financial markets persists, this looks increasingly unlikely.""There may be an opportunity for cash-rich corporates to come in now, but any increase of activity from their side is unlikely to fill the void left by private equity,"" said Mark Lloyd Williams, a partner at the Norton Rose law firm in London. ""If, as an investment bank, your market is driven by a certain sector and that sector has issues at the moment, clearly there is a problem for you.""There are signs that credit has not dried up completely. Large corporations that may be perceived as less risky investments can still tap the credit markets, as illustrated by Rio Tinto. The mining company, whose shares trade in London, raised a $40 billion loan last month to fund the takeover of Alcan, the Canadian aluminum producer.Others even profited from the stock market swings. ICAP, the world's largest broker of transactions between banks, said Wednesday that electronic trading in August reached a record ""in the face of highly volatile trading."""
24,"PARIS —The OECD on Wednesday reduced its forecast for U.S. economic growth and recommended a rapid cut in interest rates to limit the fallout from a housing and mortgage market slump that has sparked global financial market turmoil.In an update to its economic forecasts for major industrial nations, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development also said interest rates should not be raised for the moment in Japan or the 13-country euro currency zone.It said it was impossible at present to evaluate the potential damage which broader financial market turmoil could add to the direct impact of a sharp downturn in U.S. housing and a defaults crisis in the subprime mortgage market there.""Downside risks have become more ominous,"" the OECD's chief economist, Jean-Philippe Cotis, said in a statement.The OECD was not for now predicting U.S. recession but was not discounting the possibility either, he added in an interview with Reuters.He recommended that the U.S. Federal Reserve reduce its key interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point this month to shore up growth, but without going so far as to give foolhardy investors the idea that public authorities would always be there to bail them out by cutting the cost of credit.He presented updated GDP forecasts for several countries and said U.S. growth was expected to be 1.9 percent this year rather than 2.1 percent forecast previously, and that growth in third and fourth quarters would be much weaker than a surprisingly strong showing reported for the April-June period.""Recent developments have revealed serious imperfections in the functioning of U.S. housing markets and, more broadly, in credit markets worldwide,"" Cotis said.The U.S. housing market downturn is widely regarded to have set in two years ago but the troubles caused by rising interest rates on already high-cost loans to poor, or subprime, borrowers surfaced later, recently triggering fears of a wider U.S. slump and global credit crunch. ""Our diagnosis is a slowdown,"" Cotis said, conceding that the downturn was bigger than the OECD had expected. ""We cannot rule out a recession,"" he added.The OECD forecast third-quarter growth of 0.5 percent in GDP quarter-on-quarter, which is roughly 2 percent annualised, and a subsequent 0.4 percent for the fourth quarter, which equates to about 1.6 percent in standard U.S. data publications.Those predictions were on the high side, with large margins of error and an as yet unquantifiable hit from market turmoil that could potentially push either quarter to zero growth or even a contraction, Cotis said.In Europe, growth remained relatively dynamic, and the case for further rises in ECB rates for the euro zone was valid, but not until it became clearer how the gyrations in fragile and fear-riven financial markets would pan out over time, he said.""For now, 'stay put',"" he said of ECB rate policy ahead of a Thursday meeting of the euro zone's central bank, which has been steadily raising rates since December 2005 as the economy of the region began to pull out of the doldrums.His advice was broadly similar for the Bank of Japan, which has for years had to worry about deflation rather than the risk of inflation that the primary concern of central banks in much of the rest of the world.The OECD's forecasts for growth in 2007 as a whole were held at 2.4 percent for Japan and trimmed minimally for the euro area, to 2.6 percent from 2.7.The OECD and Cotis offered no advice on rates to the Bank of England but raised its growth forecast for Britain markedly, to 3.1 percent from 2.7 while it cut Italy's forecast growth to 1.8 percent from 2.0 and raised Canada's to 2.7 percent from 2.5.Cotis said he still believed other regions such as Europe and Japan could avoid being pulled down as hard as the United States even if the world's largest economy flirted with recession.""There'd be an impact but would not drag Europe onto the same path as U.S. ... Asia has a momentum of its own, there are consumers there too,"" he said.He stressed that the problem at the moment was one caused in the first place by trouble in the subprime segement of the U.S. home loans sector.While the trouble also concerned exposure to such debt via debt derivatives markets, this was not as big and broad a bubble as the one that preceded the dot-com crash six years ago.""This is not 2001, when the stock market bubble was a much wider phenomenon. It's not the same thing. We're not talking about a share problem of the same intensity,"" he said."
25,"BOSTON —As subprime borrowers began to default on their mortgages in rapidly growing numbers this year, credit card issuers increased their efforts to sign up such customers with tarnished financial histories, according to a market research firm.Direct mail credit card offers to subprime customers in the United States jumped 41 percent in the first half of this year, compared with the first half of 2006, according to Mintel International Group.Direct mail offers intended for customers with the best credit fell more than 13 percent.Yet, during this same period, defaults on subprime mortgages rose significantly. In June, nearly one in five subprime mortgages was at least 60 days past due, and more than one in 20 were in foreclosure, according to First American LoanPerformance, a firm in San Francisco that collects and analyzes mortgage data.Though it seems counterintuitive to extend credit to households already struggling with debt, the meltdown in the housing and the mortgage markets probably led credit card issuers to increase their marketing to subprime customers, said Julie Lizer, the manager of custom research at Mintel.As home values decline and lenders balk at writing subprime mortgages, these customers can no longer refinance and tap into home equity for cash.That leaves credit cards as their only option, Lizer said.The increase in direct mail to subprime customers tracks the slide in the housing market. In June, offers to these households were nearly double those of June 2005, near the peak of the U.S. housing market, she said. Mintel estimates mail volumes based on surveys of representative U.S. households.""The companies are seeing a market need, and filling it by increasing mail to these consumers,"" Lizer said.But consumer advocates worry that targeting subprime customers may worsen their problems.""This causes us great concern that some major credit card issuers are marketing to people who are in a risky financial position,"" said Travis Plunkett, the legislative director of the Consumer Federation of America.""It's another sign that some credit card issuers are engaging in risky, irresponsible lending to vulnerable consumers.""Plunkett, in Congressional testimony, cited research that showed fees charged to subprime borrowers making late card payments can exceed their interest payments.Borrowers are classified as subprime if they have past credit problems, like late or missing payments.The subprime mortgage meltdown has sent ripple effects throughout the economy. In recent months, several mortgage companies specializing in subprime loans, including New Century Financial, filed for bankruptcy.The problem then spread to financial markets, wiping out hedge funds that invested heavily in subprime mortgages, and forcing the Federal Reserve and central banks of other nations to pump more than $100 billion into the global banking system to avert a credit crisis. Many financial analysts say the Fed may soon cut a key interest rate to stabilize the economy.But card issuers say the flurry of marketing to subprime borrowers is a sign of healthy competition. Keith Leggett, a senior economist at the American Bankers Association, said direct mail offers were typically intended to lure customers who have credit cards away from competitors. This means better rates and terms for borrowers.""Consumers should be grateful that we have a very competitive market,"" he said.For credit card companies, the subprime market is a profitable one, analysts and consumer advocates say. Subprime customers, charged higher rates than those with better credit, are more likely to make minimum payments, maintaining balances that generate interest revenue for card issuers, consumer advocates said.HSBC Holdings of London leads the direct mail surge, according to Mintel. Its mail offers to subprime households in the first six months of the year more than doubled from 2006."

29,"WASHINGTON, Sept. 5 (Reuters)  The Securities and Exchange Commission is looking at whether unwinding financing vehicles like conduits could strain the balance sheets of major investment banks, top officials said Wednesday.So far, it seems there is no reason to be concerned, the S.E.C. chairman, Christopher Cox, said.Commercial and investment banks globally have packaged billions of dollars of debt into vehicles that sell short-term bonds to investors. But if investors stop buying the short-term debt, banks may have to step in, essentially to buy back assets from the vehicles, which are known as conduits and structured investment vehicles.Commercial banks are typically the main guarantors for these vehicles and so are most likely to be obligated to buy back assets. But to the extent that asset values are broadly depressed by conduit unwinding, or that investment banks have direct exposure to conduits, they could also suffer.Erik R. Sirri, market regulation director for the S.E.C., said the commission was monitoring situations that might put a strain on the balance sheets of broker-dealers.“These include the potential unwinding of off-balance sheet funding structures, such as conduit structures,” Mr. Sirri said.Mr. Cox said on Bloomberg television that risk to the financial system, known as systemic risk, is a main focus for the regulator.“We take a look at the parent level, make sure that there are no liquidity issues, and at this juncture we are satisfied that that’s the case,” he said.When asked whether he is satisfied that companies like Citigroup, which have billions of assets in structured investment vehicles, are in good financial shape, Mr. Cox said: “Yes, we are comfortable.”Moody’s Investors Service said Wednesday that it had cut, or might cut, ratings on $14 billion of debt issued by structured investment vehicles hit by market turmoil amid the subprime mortgage crisis."
30,"Citigroup said yesterday that it was shutting its Tribeca Global Investments hedge fund, in the first significant move since Vikram S. Pandit took over its alternative investment group.The move is intended to eliminate about 50 jobs and improve performance as the division absorbs Old Lane Partners, a similar investment fund that Citigroup bought in April for more than $800 million as a way to bring in Mr. Pandit and his partners.Old Lane, with about $4.25 billion in assets, will become a flagship hedge fund.Still, the closing of Tribeca is the boldest step that Mr. Pandit has made since early July, when he took control of the investment unit, a small and long-overlooked part of the global banking giant’s empire. And it comes at a time when other banks are retooling or scaling back their hedge funds in the wake of heavy losses from the crisis in the credit markets.Bear Stearns, for example, said in July that it was forced to liquidate two asset management funds related to its exposure in the subprime mortgage market. In May, UBS closed Dillon Read Capital Management, its internal hedge fund.Although Citigroup said it was not closing Tribeca because of losses, the fund has struggled. It gained 1.2 percent through July, according to Hedge Fund Research, compared with the 7.6 percent the average hedge fund gained. Tribeca lost 2.8 percent in August, bringing it to a 1.6 percent decline in the first eight months of the year.“That is not the type of performance you would expect from a hedge fund with that type of resources and size,” said Bradley H. Alford, the former managing director of Duke University’s endowment, who now runs Alpha Capital Management in Atlanta.Tribeca has about $2.4 billion in assets, with roughly $1.5 billion of that Citigroup’s money.Fund executives expect to return $500 million to investors over the next few weeks, a person involved in the matter said.That will allow Citigroup to take control of the fund, though it has not been decided whether its money will be transferred to Old Lane or invested elsewhere, this person said. About $400 million in convertibles and Asian securities, belonging to both Citigroup and other investors, is expected to remain with the bank’s alternative investment group.Citigroup also said it was establishing a “feeder fund” to allow individual investors in the bank’s global wealth management division to gain access to Old Lane. Previously, Old Lane took money only from institutional investors.Citigroup executives suggested in a memo that the primary reason for closing Tribeca was related to strategy.“We believe that we can best serve our clients by offering a single multistrategy hedge fund platform,” wrote John Havens, who was a founder of Old Lane with Mr. Pandit and is president of the alternative investment group. “These are the first steps in creating a nimble organization, driven by performance and service.”Tribeca Capital Management, which Citigroup began in 2004, had been troubled by bloated costs and weak results since it was founded. It has had four managers over the last three years. And it waxed and waned as a corporate priority.But in the last two years, as rivals like JPMorgan Chase reaped windfalls from their hedge funds, executives said that bolstering Tribeca and the overall alternative investment unit at Citigroup vaulted to the top of the list.Yet the company’s chairman and chief executive, Charles O. Prince III, did not leap to a decision. The job was left vacant for more than a year, after the departure of Michael A. Carpenter in March 2006. Only in April did he recruit Mr. Pandit, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker, and his Old Lane partners.Over the summer, Mr. Pandit and his people have had frequent discussions with several of Citigroup’s top executives, including Mr. Prince; Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary who is chairman of the bank’s executive committee; and senior top officials in the investment banking and wealth management divisions.The announcement yesterday was the first major initiative. About 50 of Tribeca’s 90 employees, including portfolio managers and support staff members, were told that their jobs were being eliminated, a person close to the situation said. Most of the layoffs will be in New York.With a new management team in place, Old Lane’s partners will run the hedge fund’s operations. And in a memo to employees, Mr. Havens said that the company had “numerous single-strategy products” in place and would roll out new products shortly.Tribeca, which had about 25 trading strategies, will contribute about four strategies that will be incorporated into future fund offerings, a person briefed on the situation said."
31,"Stocks fell yesterday as investors were unsettled by reports that showed the troubles in the housing market were deepening even as a Federal Reserve survey of regional conditions found little evidence of the turmoil’s having damaged other parts of the economy.The sell-off briefly intensified as the release of the Fed’s beige book, which summarizes anecdotal reports about the economy from business executives across the country, led some investors to conclude that Fed policy makers would be less inclined to cut interest rates after their meeting on Sept. 18, given the relatively benign report.When Fed officials next meet, they are widely expected to reduce the key lending rate from 5.25 percent to 5 percent or perhaps even less, but analysts are divided over how aggressively the Fed might pursue further rate cuts later this year.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed down 1.2 percent, or 17.13 points, to 1,472.29; it had fallen by as much as 1.5 percent after the beige book was released in the early afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 143.39 points, or 1.1 percent, to 13,305.47.Treasury prices jumped, as investors sought safety in debt backed by the federal government. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 4.47 percent, from 4.55 percent on Tuesday, hitting its lowest level since early December.Early yesterday, an index that tracks signing of contracts for sales of existing homes tumbled 12.2 percent for July, to its lowest level in more than six years, the National Association of Realtors reported. The trade group said its members were reporting that buyers of homes were having a tougher time obtaining financing.Pending home sales dropped by nearly 21 percent in the West, which has been hit hard by a spike in interest rates on jumbo mortgages — those for amounts higher than $417,000.“The fact is that housing troubles are still building,” said Marc D. Stern, chief investment officer at Bessemer Trust, an investment firm in New York. “To say that we have bottomed is very much premature. The effect on economic activity will grow in the second half of the year and into 2008.”The Fed report released yesterday said that the credit crisis had made it more difficult for people to obtain mortgages and that “the weakness in the housing market deepened” in most of the Federal Reserve districts. But it also said that credit remained readily available for most consumer and business borrowers and that, outside of real estate, the convulsions in financial markets had had “limited” effects on economic activity.In a speech Friday at the Fed’s annual symposium in Wyoming, the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the central bank would place more weight than usual on anecdotal reports because the incoming statistical data might not be timely enough to measure a broad economic impact of the credit crisis that began with failing subprime loans.But Fed officials made it clear last week that they were very worried about the housing market, where the news was gloomy, and the readings from other areas were mixed rather than buoyant.“They are going to take the beige book statement that it’s limited only to the housing area with a grain of salt,” said Joshua Shapiro, chief economist at MFR Inc., a research firm in New York. “There is only one wound on the body, but how big is the wound and what impact does it have on the rest of the body?”Mr. Shapiro’s firm expects the Fed to cut its benchmark interest rate, now at 5.25 percent, by 0.25 percentage point later this month and by a total of 0.75 percentage point by the end of the year. That forecast is in line with trading in the futures market.There have been only a few signs that the housing market’s problems are spilling into the economy as a whole.The beige book reported that retail sales were “modest to moderate” in most of the country, but inventory was “at or above desired levels” in districts that mentioned it. “Several retailers reported that they planned to or had already heavily discounted merchandise to move inventory,” the report said.A crucial reading on the economy that is likely to play a big role in the Fed’s decision on interest rates will come tomorrow when the Labor Department releases employment figures for August. Yesterday, a privately compiled payroll report from Automatic Data Processing showed that corporate payrolls grew by just 38,000 in August, down from 41,000 in July and 143,000 in June.Many forecasters say the economy will be able to weather a surge in mortgage defaults and falling home prices if jobs remain plentiful and wages continue rising. Experts acknowledge, however, that employment is a lagging indicator of the economy’s health and that many corporate sectors would be hurt if consumer spending deteriorated significantly.“The job market has been a stalwart of strength,” said Mr. Stern of Bessemer Trust, who does not expect a recession. “We are dependent on companies continuing to create jobs.”Among the S.&P. 500 stocks, 422 fell, 76 rose and 2 were unchanged; all but 3 of the 30 Dow companies fell. Financial stocks accounted for more than a third of the losses in the S.&P. 500. Information technology, industrial and consumer discretionary stocks accounted for a third of the decliners.Citigroup and Bank of America led the financial sector down as concerns mounted about big institutions’ involvement in off-balance-sheet borrowing in the short-term debt markets and investments in assets like mortgage bonds.A Securities and Exchange Commission official testifying before Congress said the commission was looking into such structured investment vehicles, which have had an increasingly hard time borrowing money by selling commercial paper, a type of short-term debt.Technology shares were led down by Apple, which cut the price of its new iPhone by $200 and stopped selling a lower-end version of the device just two months after introducing it. Shares of Apple fell 5.2 percent, and shares of AT&T, the service provider for the phone, lost 1.4 percent.More broadly, the beige book noted that manufacturing activity expanded, except in automobiles and building materials. But demand for business loans was either steady or declining in the New York, Cleveland, Chicago and St. Louis districts.Given the turmoil and volatility in the financial markets in the last month and a half, some market specialists say the Fed may be forced to be freer with a rate cut than it normally would be.“It would be psychological,” said Bruce Bittles, chief market strategist at Robert W. Baird & Company. “It would leave room for further rate cuts if needed. There is no guarantee that lower rates will help this housing situation. The important thing is that it stabilizes other areas like the stock market.”Following are the results of yesterday’s Treasury auction of 4-week bills:"
32,"Edward M. Gramlich, a former governor of the Federal Reserve who warned of a looming crisis in home mortgages and who ran a federal board created to aid the airlines after the September 2001 attacks, died yesterday in Washington. He was 68.Mr. Gramlich’s death, from acute myeloid leukemia, was announced by the Urban Institute, a Washington research organization where Mr. Gramlich was a senior fellow.He was named to the Federal Reserve by President Bill Clinton in 1997 and served until 2005.“His contributions to the Federal Reserve were broad and significant,” Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said in a statement yesterday.As chairman of the federal Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, he urged legislators to better protect consumers against predatory lenders and to toughen regulation of mortgage lenders and banks.His efforts met resistance within the Fed and on Capitol Hill, and he said later that he could have pushed for reform sooner.In June, the Urban Institute published his book, “Subprime Mortgages: America’s Latest Boom and Bust,” which offered solutions for the mortgage crisis.Mr. Gramlich was too ill to attend a Fed economic symposium held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., last week. But in a speech delivered for him at the conference, Mr. Gramlich said the subprime market had become a “Wild West” of loans made without any federal supervision. “The predictable result was carnage,” Mr. Gramlich said in his remarks.Mr. Gramlich aroused unusual controversy for a Fed member during his tenure as chairman of the Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which was created by Congress to oversee loan guarantees for the struggling airlines after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.Mr. Gramlich twice voted with other board members to reject a loan package for United Airlines, which owned two of the planes that were hijacked that day. Mr. Gramlich said he was convinced the airline could reorganize itself without federal help.United, which had filed for bankruptcy protection after its first application was rejected, sought deep cuts from its unions after its bid was turned down a second time. It eventually emerged from bankruptcy last year, without a loan package.Edward Martin Gramlich was born on June 18, 1939, in Rochester, where his father was an engineer for the Eastman Kodak Company.A former minor league batboy, he was later staff director of an economic study commission on Major League Baseball, in 1992.Mr. Gramlich attended Williams College and received a master’s degree and a doctorate in economics from Yale.Starting in 1965, when he joined the research division at the Federal Reserve, Mr. Gramlich’s career spanned the academic and government worlds.Mr. Gramlich served as deputy and acting director of the Congressional Budget Office, and at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor he was a professor of economics. He headed the university’s public institute and served as interim provost in 2005 and 2006.Mr. Gramlich is survived by his wife, Ruth; a son, Robert; a daughter, Sarah; and six grandchildren, as well as his parents, Jacob Edward Gramlich and Harriet Williams Gramlich.Mr. Gramlich had survived acute lymphocytic leukemia, a relatively treatable form of blood cancer, but in March he found that he had the more lethal type. In an interview published on Aug. 18, he discussed his decision not to undergo an experimental treatment. Last month, Mr. Gramlich discontinued the treatment he had been receiving; on Friday, he entered the Washington Home and Community Hospices, where he died.As the author of a book on cost-benefit analysis, Mr. Gramlich said, he had weighed the pros and cons of the treatment offered him by Johns Hopkins, which he was told would not prolong his life and might shorten it. There also was no chance of remission, Mr. Gramlich said.Having made the decision, he said he had no regrets. “I’ve already had a long ‘saying goodbye’ period,” he said."
33,"DUBLIN, Sept. 5 — An Irish court on Wednesday appointed an examiner to oversee the restructuring of a small financial company as it tried to repay a portion of $238 million owed some of the world’s largest investment banks.Justice Mary Finlay Geoghegan ruled that at least a part of the company, Structured Credit, had a reasonable chance to survive if it could raise $125 million from shareholders. She approved Structured Credit’s request to restructure rather than liquidate.The court also heard details of the amounts that Structured Credit owed the 12 banks. One bank, Morgan Stanley, which favored liquidation, said Structured Credit owed it $93.7 million.Wednesday’s hearing was one of the largest commercial cases to be heard by an Irish court, with about 40 lawyers and advisers jammed into a small courtroom.With the ruling, Structured Credit became the latest company to be enveloped by a crisis in subprime lending that has spread in the global credit market.The company ran headlong into the crisis when customer demands for collateral climbed from $5 million in late June to $438 million in mid-August. The demands forced the company to seek court protection on Aug. 20 from a creditor, Nomura Bank Holdings, which said it was owed $28 million.With 10 employees and offices in a Georgian-era building overlooking one of the finest 18th-century private squares in central Dublin, Structured Credit worked in a segment of the derivatives market called credit risk transfer. The company raised $207.8 million in early 2006, enough to give it entry into the world’s $34.5 trillion derivatives markets.The company underwrote derivatives that were intended to offset risk, providing protection for its investment bank customers against losses beyond certain agreed amounts.Since June 2006, the company had signed 48 agreements to pay its 12 customers — which included Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, Merrill Lynch and UBS — collateral, in cash, if the derivative contracts it underwrote fell below certain amounts.Market specialists say that Structured Credit, because of its size, was probably ill prepared when the crisis hit the derivatives market.“I am surprised that such a small firm is operating in that space. It’s usually only the biggest that are involved,” said Andrew Dillon, managing director of Baronsmead Partners Ireland, a seller of professional indemnity insurance to bankers.Started in June 2006, Structured Credit, which was led by Edward M. Bowers, raised $207.8 million from investors that included the private equity fund Aquiline Financial Services in New York; the California Public Employees’ Retirement System, or Calpers; the Canadian pension fund Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec; the Calyon unit of the Crédit Agricole Group; and the American mortgage insurer Triad Guaranty.According to company records, Mr. Bowers set up Structured Credit after working for the mortgage insurer Radian Group. The chairman of Structured Credit, Geoffrey O. Kalish, was a senior principal at the company’s largest shareholder, Aquiline.From Ireland, the company hired Keith Dignam as its finance director. Mr. Dignam had worked for large American and Irish banks and had advised clients on mortgage-backed securities.In March, Structured Credit said as a “testament” to its “potential importance to the Irish economy” the minister for finance, Brian Cowen, had attended the opening of its offices on Fitzwilliam Square.In its 2006 annual report, the company spelled out its ambitions. It had applied for a banking license in Ireland and had started discussions with the major credit rating agencies in London for a rating.Through a holding company, Structured Credit Holdings, it set up offices in New York and London. And in its first year, the company underwrote $5 billion of derivative credit risk agreements with 12 banks.But the seeds of what Structured Credit describes in court documents as an “unanticipated” crisis were set during an extraordinary few weeks in July and August.In court on Wednesday, reports by an independent auditor, Ernst & Young, showed that during those weeks, Structured Credit posted collateral of $175 million to 10 investment banks.The reports showed that it paid Morgan Stanley $66.4 million; Bear Stearns $29.25 million; Nomura $20.6 million; the French bank Natixis $12.1 million; Bank of America $10.9 million; HSBC $5.1 million; Deutsche Bank $2.6 million; and UBS $2.2 million.The escalation in collateral payments was also laid out in documents Nomura presented to the court on Aug. 17 when the bank sought to have Structured Credit liquidated. At Wednesday’s hearing, however, Nomura did not object to the appointment of an examiner.In August court filings, Nomura said that although Structured Credit was able to pay a cash call of $9.47 million on July 27, three other demands were not paid. Other banks, including Nomura, made similar demands, the court heard on Wednesday. By mid-August, cash demands reached $438 million, according to court documents.On Aug. 13, according to Nomura filings, Structured Credit wrote its 12 customers to say that because of the “uniquely challenging market environment,” it would seek a voluntary liquidation or try to get its 12 customers to agree to cap their cash or collateral demands.Four days later, Nomura asked the Irish High Court to liquidate Structured Credit. But on Aug. 20, Structured Credit secured the appointment of an interim examiner, giving it protection from its creditors.Although many of the lawyers involved in the case expected the court to liquidate the company, the judge offered Structured Credit an opportunity to restructure.On Wednesday, representatives of Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and Citibank all declined to comment. Mr. Bowers, Structured Credit’s chief executive, also declined to comment.Richard Hunter, regional credit officer at Fitch, the credit rating agency in London, said that other companies and banks faced the possible escalation of cash demands similar to the amounts faced by Structured Credit.“I would not be surprised that we had a number of institutions that we rate who had seen their collateral calls move up in that range,” Mr. Hunter said. “But most of the companies that we rate have three-digit-billion balance sheets. That type of move, while chunky, is not something that is life threatening” to bigger companies."
34,"FRANKFURT —As Europe continues to absorb shock waves from the crisis in the American mortgage market, leading financial figures here are starting to acknowledge that the turmoil could have a lingering impact on European banks and on broader economic prospects.The European Central Bank on Thursday reduced its forecast for growth in Europe this year, and warned that continued volatility in financial markets could dampen its projections further. ""The level of uncertainty has augmented in a very significant fashion,"" the bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said at a news conference. He said there had been a loss of confidence ""in a large array"" of markets.Citing these uncertainties, the bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent, shifting course from a month ago, when it signaled it would raise the rate by a quarter point in September. With credit becoming tight throughout the banking system, economists said the European Central Bank no longer needed to tighten its monetary policy. Commercial banks, by charging each other higher borrowing rates, are, in effect, doing the bank's work for it, they said.""We will not go back to the easy lending conditions that existed before,"" said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. ""What we are witnessing is the bursting of a credit bubble.""The bank reduced its growth projection only modestly - to 2.5 percent, compared with a previous forecast of 2.6 percent. And it left its forecast of 2.3 percent for next year unchanged. But Trichet cautioned that these estimates were of limited use during a time of extreme volatility.""He made it very clear that they are aware that there could be a much bigger impact than the forecasts imply,"" said Holger Schmieding, senior European economist at Bank of America in London.While Trichet warned that rattled markets could affect the outlook for Europe, the chief executive of one of its largest banks, Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank, has offered a sober assessment of how the meltdown in the mortgage market is likely to affect his own balance sheet. In an unusual statement issued Tuesday, Ackermann said Deutsche Bank's linchpin sales and trading and corporate finance operations would be hit by the upheaval in the credit markets. He did not offer numbers, but analysts said they expected a significant drop in third-quarter results.Deutsche Bank said it sponsored €32 billion, or $43.8 billion, worth of asset-backed securities. But it said the investors who bought this commercial paper do not have exposure to subprime mortgages.""It's another example of banks gradually having to give out more information on their situations,"" said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London. ""They're trying to suggest the situation is not as bad as some may have feared.""Two other German banks, Landesbank Sachsen Girozentrale, known as SachsenLB, and IKB Deutsche Industriebank, were nearly ruined by exposure to subprime mortgages, which were rolled into complex packages of asset-backed securities.IKB, now in the process of being bailed out by a consortium of German banks, said Monday that it would lose up to €700 million in this fiscal year. SachsenLB has been rescued through a takeover by a fellow regional bank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.Investors here are nervous about further financial land mines, not necessarily at major institutions like Deutsche Bank, but at smaller banks, which analysts said were attracted to the rich returns of these asset-backed securities, and may not have properly understood the risks buried in them.Research done by Deutsche Bank shows why it may prove particularly difficult to allay the fears of Europeans.While the bank estimates that foreign investors own only 28 percent of the total market for asset-backed securities in the United States - some $600 billion - foreigners own nearly 40 percent of the more troubled category of mortgage-backed securities, which includes subprime loans.Of this subset, West Europeans own a disproportionate 57 percent. Britain, the Netherlands and Germany are the three largest European holders of mortgage-backed securities. Deutsche Bank estimates. Asian banks, by contrast, own only 12.5 percent of these investments.Reinhard Schmidt, a professor of international banking at the University of Frankfurt, said he expected more bad news from European banks, given what he described as an ""unhealthy mixture"" of risky assets, lack of transparency, and inadequate regulation.Ackermann, however, said he was ""optimistic about the environment globally for financial institutions,"" and added that Deutsche Bank has not had trouble getting access to funds.Still, credit in Europe continues to be tight. The European Central Bank injected funds into the market on Thursday, to bring down overnight lending rates, which had spiked above its benchmark rate. It also announced a supplementary, three-month refinancing operation to further lubricate the system.These are the bank's latest steps since Aug. 9, when it injected €94.8 billion, amid signs that the subprime mess in the United States was mutating into a full-blown global credit crisis.Trichet evinced pride in the bank's intervention, saying, ""At whatever level, we have to get a market that will function.""His pride was evident at another moment, when he rebuked President Nicolas Sarkozy of France for appearing to take credit, in remarks to reporters in France, for the bank's decision Thursday not to raise rates. Sarkozy has called on the bank in recent weeks to delay further increases. ""Everybody knows that we are fiercely independent,"" Trichet said, in a rare burst of emotion.He was more circumspect about assessing the current crisis. Trichet said it was too early to draw definitive lessons, beyond the basic observation that ""transparency is of the essence.""While Trichet indicated that the bank would still like to nudge up rates, his repeated references to uncertainty left many bank watchers doubtful that the ECB would raise rates again this year."

36,"FRANKFURT —The European Central Bank held off on raisingits benchmark interest rate Thursday, staying at 4 percent in a nod to thevolatility that has engulfed global markets since early August.The decision to keep rates on hold had grown more expected in recent days,with the ECB issuing an unorthodox message Wednesday that it was ""ready tocontribute to orderly conditions in the euro money market."" Markets willbe looking for hints from Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet if the rateincrease originally telegraphed for this month could still come this year.Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England also left its benchmark rateunchanged, at 5.75 percent. That came a day after it offered to provideextra cash to reduce ""unusually high"" overnight lending rates in itsmonthly market operations, reflecting concern about dwindling credit levelsspurred by the problems of the U.S. subprime mortgage market.The ECB had created waves on Wednesday when it issued a statement sayingit was prepared to ""act accordingly"" in light of renewed marketvolatility. Markets and analysts took that as a signal that the keyrefinancing rate would remain at 4 percent, and that more money would bemade available for unsettled markets.Even as the ECB meeting got under way, the bank offered up more cash tobanks, injecting another €42.2 billion (US$57.3 billion), its fifthunscheduled tender in the past month aimed at calming the jitters andproviding much-needed liquidity to banks. So far, it has lent some €253billion (US$343.8 billion) from the five one-day offers.The bank, trying to guide the 13-nation euro zone through the storm ofvolatility, said it received €90.8 billion (US$123.4 billion) in bids fromThursday's offer, a clear sign that banks are still hungry for extra cash.The ECB, which sets monetary policy for a bloc of 317 million people thataccounts for some 15 percent of the world's gross domestic product, saidWednesday it might take action to ""contribute to orderly conditions.""""Volatility in the euro money market has increased and the ECB is closelymonitoring the situation,"" the bank said. ""Should this persist tomorrow,the ECB stands ready to contribute to orderly conditions in the euro moneymarket.""Most analysts believed until recently that the bank would lift interestrates to 4.25 percent, but that changed following the past month's marketturbulence — a result of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.""Five weeks after the European Central Bank virtually pre-announced arate hike for Sept. 6, the persistent turmoil in the money market willlikely force the ECB to stay on hold instead,"" said Holger Schmieding,Bank of America's chief economist for Europe.Thirty-nine out of 51 private-sector banks polled by Dow Jones Newswiresforecast that the ECB would leave the refinancing rate at 4 percent onThursday. Thirty-three of them predicted the rate would hit 4.25 percent bythe end of this year.The bank's message Wednesday had some market observers conjecturing thatit may be poised to mirror a move by the U.S. Federal Reserve and lower itslending rate for overnight funds, its marginal lending facility.That facility has stood 1 percentage point above than the main refinancingminimum bid rate for years."
37,"SEOUL —An appeals court on Thursday suspended a three-year prison term for fraud imposed on Hyundai Motor's chairman, Chung Mong Koo, enabling the tycoon to continue running the world's sixth-largest automaker as it faces slowing demand and stiffer competition abroad.Analysts had expected the verdict. South Korean appeals courts are often lenient with leading businessmen convicted of white-collar crimes because they are considered too important to the economy to spend time behind bars.But the ruling sparked outrage from anti-corruption campaigners.The verdict came on the same day that South Korea's antitrust regulators fined Hyundai Motor and four other Hyundai affiliates a total of 63.1 billion won, or $67 million, for violating fair-trading rules.""We are greatly relieved that this matter is finally over,"" said Jake Jang, a Hyundai spokesman. ""We can now devote our full energy to addressing numerous challenges that face us and to building a global brand.""The company would use the case as a lesson to improve ""management transparency,"" Jang said.Chung's family also reconfirmed its earlier promise to donate a trillion won to charity in a show of contrition.In February, the Seoul District Court convicted Chung, 69, of embezzling company funds between April 2000 and March 2006 into a 103.4 billion won slush fund. Some 70 billion won was used to pay lobbyists to gain government favors and for personal use, prosecutors said.On Thursday, the Seoul Appeals Court upheld the conviction but suspended the prison term. After two months in jail last year, Chung was released on bail, continuing his work as Hyundai chairman.Prosecutors can appeal to the Supreme Court. But there is little chance of Chung returning to jail. By law, the Supreme Court cannot increase or reduce prison terms; it simply decides whether the conviction was legitimate.The presiding judge, Lee Jae Hong, said he was aware of criticism that South Korean judges had been ""lenient toward white-collar crimes"" and toward ""chaebol,"" or family-controlled conglomerates like Hyundai, which dominate the economy. But he said he also feared that sending Chung to prison might disrupt Hyundai, which generates 7 percent of the country's total exports, and ""endanger our economy.""Chung is widely known in South Korea as a micromanager with a top-down operating style.In 2004, the Seoul District Court cited similar reasons when it suspended a three-year prison term for fraud for Chey Tae Won, chief executive of SK, the country's top oil refiner, so he could carry on running the company.Most South Korean big businesses depend heavily on their chief executives for management decisions. Since Chung faced criminal charges last year, Hyundai has been engulfed in uncertainty over its ambitious plans to expand production in the United States, China, India and East Europe with the aim of becoming the fifth biggest carmaker by 2010.Hyundai this week cut its 2007 U.S. sales target by 8.1 percent amid concerns that the subprime mortgage crisis is weighing on consumer demand there. The company also cut its 2007 sales forecast in China by 16 percent on sluggish demand.""More than any other big South Korean firm, Hyundai Motor depends on its CEO for key decision-making,"" said Kevin Lee, an auto industry analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. ""Today's ruling lifts a big concern off Hyundai.""But critics fumed at the ruling.""This again proves that in South Korea, if you are rich and powerful, you can walk away with light punishment,"" said Lee Sang Min, an official at People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a civic watchdog on big businesses. ""The court says it ruled for the sake of the economy. If it really considered the economy, it should have established the rules of a market economy.""Earlier Thursday, the government's Fair Trade Commission announced that Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, and three other Hyundai affiliates had engaged in unfair trade by financially supporting each other.Hyundai and Kia, for example, paid higher prices for products from Hyundai Steel than those from its competitors, the commission said. They also gave 1.3 trillion won worth of delivery orders to Glovis, a logistics company that is owned by Chung and his son, Eui Sun, without competitive bidding.Glovis gets about 80 percent of its logistics orders from Hyundai group affiliates. To critics, it has become a prime example of how affiliates of a chaebol conglomerate shore up each other financially, often with the covert aim of enriching the controlling family."

The company also cut its 2007 sales forecast in China by 16 percent on sluggish demand.""More than any other big South Korean firm, Hyundai Motor depends on its CEO for key decision-making,"" said Kevin Lee, an auto industry analyst at Goodmorning Shinhan Securities. ""Today's ruling lifts a big concern off Hyundai.""But critics fumed at the ruling.""This again proves that in South Korea, if you are rich and powerful, you can walk away with light punishment,"" said Lee Sang Min, an official at People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy, a civic watchdog on big businesses. ""The court says it ruled for the sake of the economy. If it really considered the economy, it should have established the rules of a market economy.""Earlier Thursday, the government's Fair Trade Commission announced that Hyundai Motor, Kia Motors, and three other Hyundai affiliates had engaged in unfair trade by financially supporting each other.Hyundai and Kia, for example, paid higher prices for products from Hyundai Steel than those from its competitors, the commission said. They also gave 1.3 trillion won worth of delivery orders to Glovis, a logistics company that is owned by Chung and his son, Eui Sun, without competitive bidding.Glovis gets about 80 percent of its logistics orders from Hyundai group affiliates. To critics, it has become a prime example of how affiliates of a chaebol conglomerate shore up each other financially, often with the covert aim of enriching the controlling family."
39,"LONDON —The European Central Bank provided emergency funds to turbulent money markets on Thursday, mirroring its Australian counterpart, as the global credit crisis doused expectations for a euro zone rate rise.ECB policymakers are meeting, with analysts widely expecting them to leave their main interest rate on hold at 4 percent as they gauge the impact of recent credit market upheaval.The German business daily Handelsblatt reported that the ECB bank would not rule out the euro zone economy being hurt by the liquidity crisis, citing what it said was an ECB report to a committee advising European Union finance ministers.Early on Thursday, the ECB added temporary funds to money markets in a quick one-day tender. It allotted 42.245 billion euros after liquidity-starved banks bid for over twice that sum.The ECB said on Wednesday it was watching the market closely and stood ready to normalise conditions after overnight money traded near a six-year high above 4.50 percent.Some traders raised the possibility that it may cut the rate it charges banks for emergency loans, as the U.S. Federal Reserve did last month.A decision of that sort would be announced at 1145 GMT, when the bank pronounces on official interest rates.Central banks across the world have poured cash in over the past month but with limited effect.The global credit squeeze remained as tight as ever.Banks have shied away from lending over the past month as they scrambled to calculate exposure to mass defaults on the U.S. subprime mortgages, lent mainly to poor people.Australia's central bank supplied more funds than banks had asked for and widened its repo operations on Thursday, seeking to ease the widespread scarcity of short-term funds.""The news out of the credit market continues to be very ugly so, while you've got that, markets are going to continue to be very volatile,"" said Tim Rocks, equity strategist at Macquarie Securities in Hong Kong.Uncertainty has been heightened by the fact troubled structured investment vehicles (SIVs) do not necessarily show up on balance sheets. Moody's Investors Service said on Wednesday it was taking ratings action on $14 billion of SIV debt.These risky investment vehicles have raised cheap cash by issuing short-term commercial paper and buying higher-yielding securities, often U.S. mortgages, pocketing the difference.A $113 billion wall of outstanding commercial paper matures next week and will require new funding, said Lehman Brothers, citing Dealogic data -- more than the $100 billion that matured in mid-August when the credit crunch first reached a peak.The Bank of England, like the ECB, is expected to leave rates on hold on Thursday, as the Canadian and Australian central banks did on Wednesday.But investors are looking to the Federal Reserve's meeting on Sept. 18 as the crucial one. Nothing but a rate cut will calm market turbulence, which is now being whipped up by the threat of a U.S. recession.Before the liquidity crunch cast a shadow over the global economic outlook, Canada and the ECB were expected to raise rates this month while the Fed was seen on indefinite hold.William Rhodes, senior vice chairman of Citigroup Inc, said, the U.S. economy would inevitably take a hit from the subprime crisis. How hard remained to be seen, he added.""In the United States there will be an impact on the real economy, and that depends on the impact on the consumer,"" Rhodes told a meeting of the World Economic Forum in China. ""If it affects in any way strongly the consumer, then you've got a problem.""Evidence the subprime housing crisis was continuing to wreak havoc on home soil came in the form of a large fall in pending sales of existing U.S. homes and from the corporate world.Wednesday data showed pending sales of existing U.S. homes plunged by a record 12.2 percent in July, while private employers hired the fewest workers in more than four years in August.Countrywide Financial Corp, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said on Wednesday it would cut 900 jobs across the country, primarily in its mortgage production divisions.Mortgage insurer MGIC Investment Corp and bond insurer Radian Group Inc terminated a $5.47 billion merger because of deteriorating market conditions."
40,"MELBOURNE —Central banks around the globe reacted Thursday to stem damage from the U.S. subprime credit rout.The Australian central bank said that it would buy debt backed by home loans to add cash to the financial system, after the recent turmoil in markets eroded demand for asset-backed securities and drove up interest rates.The European Central Bank injected an additional €42.25 billion, or $57.7 billion, into money markets to reduce the cost of credit for commercial banks just hours before it announced it would keep its benchmark interest rate at 4 percent.Earlier Thursday, the Bank of England left its benchmark rate unchanged at 5.75 percent as policy makers tried to prevent an increase in corporate borrowing costs from hurting growth.The ECB held its marginal lending rate, at which banks can get emergency overnight loans, steady at 5 percent and maintained its deposit rate at 3 percent.Most analysts had believed until recently that the ECB would lift interest rates to 4.25 percent, but that changed following the past month's market turbulence, a result of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis.The ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said that the euro-zone economy was still humming despite the recent market turbulence, but that the bank would monitor the economic conditions very closely.While the unsettled markets and risk reappraisals in recent weeks had ""led to an increased uncertainty,"" he said, more information is needed before raising interest rates.""Given this high level of uncertainty, it is appropriate to gather additional information and to examine new data before drawing further conclusions,"" Trichet said.He also said that market volatility had exerted ""considerable influence over monetary dynamics,"" but stressed that any reaction to the U.S. subprime crisis still needed to be analyzed in depth.The moves by the central banks ""will put a bit of calm back into the markets and improve the liquidity situation,"" said Mark Bayley, director of credit and structuring at ABN AMRO Holding in Sydney.The debt purchases will increase funds available to banks and support the market for asset-backed debt in Australia, where credit markets have been roiled by losses related to debt backed by loans to U.S. homeowners.National Australia Bank, the country's largest lender, said Wednesday that an affiliate had been unable to refinance six billion Australian dollars, or $4.9 billion, of loans. On Thursday, the bank and its largest competitors threw a financial lifeline of more than 10 billion dollars to several investment vehicles.Australian lenders depend more on capital markets for funds than other banks in the Asia-Pacific, Moody's Investors Service said in a report.""Obvious concerns and volatility in the credit markets"" triggered the central bank's decision to widen the types of debt it buys in repurchases, said John Broadbent, head of domestic markets department at the Reserve Bank in Sydney. ""We need to make sure what we are dealing in, helps the markets.""The ECB move was one of many in recent weeks to add liquidity and calm markets.The Bank of England joined the world's major central banks Wednesday in easing lending between commercial banks, by offering to provide additional cash to reduce unusually high overnight interest rates."

42,"FRANKFURT, Sept. 6 — As Europe continues to absorb shock waves from the crisis in the American mortgage market, leading financial figures here are starting to acknowledge that the turmoil could have a lingering effect on European banks and on the Continent’s broader economic prospects.The European Central Bank on Thursday reduced its forecast for growth in Europe this year and warned that continued volatility in financial markets could dampen its projections further.“The level of uncertainty has augmented in a very significant fashion,” the bank’s president, Jean-Claude Trichet, said at a news conference. He said there had been a loss of confidence “in a large array” of markets.Citing these uncertainties, the bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 percent, shifting course from a month ago when it signaled it would raise the rate this month by a quarter-point. Separately, the Bank of England kept its benchmark rate at 5.75 percent.With credit constricting throughout the banking system, economists said the European Central Bank no longer needed to tighten its monetary policy. Commercial banks, by charging one another higher borrowing rates, are in effect doing the bank’s work for it, they said.“We will not go back to the easy lending conditions that existed before,” said Thomas Mayer, chief European economist at Deutsche Bank. “What we are witnessing is the bursting of a credit bubble.”The bank reduced its growth projection modestly — to 2.5 percent, compared with a previous forecast of 2.6 percent. And it left its forecast of 2.3 percent for next year unchanged. But Mr. Trichet cautioned that these estimates were of limited significance during a time of extreme volatility.“He made it very clear that they are aware that there could be a much bigger impact than the forecasts imply,” said Holger Schmieding, senior European economist at Bank of America in London.While Mr. Trichet warned that rattled markets could affect Europe’s outlook, the chief executive of one of its largest banks, Josef Ackermann of Deutsche Bank, offered a sober assessment of how the meltdown in the mortgage market was likely to affect his own balance sheet.In an unusual statement issued Tuesday, Mr. Ackermann said Deutsche Bank’s linchpin sales and trading and corporate finance operations would be hit by the upheaval in the credit markets. He did not offer numbers, but analysts expect a significant dip in third-quarter results.Deutsche Bank said it sponsored 32 billion euros ($43.5 billion) worth of asset-backed securities. But it said the investors who bought this commercial paper did not have exposure to subprime mortgages.“It’s another example of banks gradually having to give out more information on their situations,” said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights, an independent research firm in London. “They’re trying to suggest the situation is not as bad as some may have feared.”Two other German banks, Sachsen LB and IKB Deutsche Industriebank, were nearly ruined by exposure to subprime mortgages, which were rolled into complex packages of asset-backed securities.IKB, in the process of being bailed out by a consortium of German banks, said Monday that it would lose up to 700 million euros ($954 million) this fiscal year. Sachsen LB has been rescued through a takeover by a fellow regional bank, Landesbank Baden-Württemberg.Investors here are nervous about further financial landmines, not necessarily at major institutions like Deutsche Bank, but at smaller banks, which analysts said were attracted to the rich returns of these asset-backed securities and might not have properly understood the risks buried in them.Research done by Deutsche Bank showed why it might prove particularly difficult to allay the fears of Europeans.The bank estimated that foreign investors own at least $600 billion worth of American corporate asset-backed securities, or 28 percent of the total market for such investments. Foreigners own nearly 39 percent of the more troubled category of mortgage-backed securities, which includes subprime loans.Of this subset, Western Europeans own a disproportionate 57 percent. Britain, the Netherlands and Germany are the three largest European holders of mortgage-backed securities, Deutsche Bank estimated. Asian banks, by contrast, own 12.5 percent of these investments.“If you’re an Asian banker, you can make money simply by expanding your banking system,” said Reinhard H. Schmidt, a professor of international banking at the University of Frankfurt. “If you’re in Europe, where margins are low, there is tremendous pressure to get into these investments.”Professor Schmidt said he expected more bad news from European banks, given what he described as an “unhealthy mixture” of risky assets, lack of transparency and inadequate regulation.Mr. Ackermann struck a more upbeat tone, saying he was “optimistic about the environment globally for financial institutions” and noting that Deutsche Bank had no trouble getting access to funds.Still, credit in Europe continues to be tight. The European Central Bank injected cash into the market Thursday, to bring down overnight lending rates, which had risen above its benchmark rate. It also announced a supplementary three-month refinancing operation to further lubricate the system.Those were the bank’s latest steps since Aug. 9, when it injected 94.8 billion euros ($128 billion) amid signs that the subprime mess in the United States was mutating into a full-blown global credit crisis.Mr. Trichet evinced pride in the bank’s intervention, saying, “At whatever level, we have to get a market that will function.”While Mr. Trichet indicated that the bank would still like to nudge rates higher, his repeated references to uncertainty left many bank watchers doubtful that the bank would do so again this year."
43,"OTTAWA, Sept. 6 — Few of the Canadian investors left holding a once-arcane and now troubled form of short-term debt are risk takers.The unhappy owners of the debt, known as asset-backed commercial paper, include the government-owned Mortgage and Housing Corporation (257 million Canadian dollars, or $243.6 million) ; the post office (37.9 million Canadian dollars directly and 27 million more in its pension fund); Toronto’s airport authority (249 million Canadian dollars); the charter airline and tour operator Transat (154.5 million); and the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan (about 60 million).Their unhappiness stems from a common source. The turmoil in the credit markets, particularly in the United States, as well as an unusual Canadian regulation have all but shut down the market for about 34 billion Canadian dollars ($32.3 billion) in commercial paper. Until last month, this debt paper had been regarded by many as a safe alternative to cash.Now, if a proposed restructuring led by the industry succeeds, investors in the commercial paper who would ordinarily have been repaid in 30 to 60 days will find their holdings transformed into long-term notes with maturity dates measured in years.Such a possibility is unlikely to harm big investors who generally hold a small part of their cash and cash equivalents in commercial paper. But it could squeeze smaller investors who need the cash to run their businesses. It will also create headaches for money market funds that are banned by regulators from holding long-term notes.“There are investors who need their cash and weren’t expecting a two-year wait,” said Huston Loke, managing director for global structured finance at DBRS, a Toronto-based debt-rating agency.The whole matter has become something of an embarrassment for DBRS, the country’s leading rating agency. While other agencies, notably Standard & Poor’s, refused to rate the asset-backed paper because of its potential for a liquidity crisis, DBRS took on the task.The Canadian problem differs from the subprime mortgage crisis in one respect: the assets underlying the paper were regarded as generally solid. They were for the most part credit card receivables, auto loans and good-quality mortgages. Issuers consolidate them and then slice the debt up into short-term units with 30-to-90-day maturities.To make commercial paper an attractive way to hold cash, its issuers also line up banks to guarantee its liquidity if the issuers are not able to roll over the paper to other investors at maturity. But in Canada, the banks have to support commercial paper only when they decide that there is a “general market disruption.”Last month’s problem began after an issuer, Coventree, could not roll over notes and was unable to persuade its bankers to step in. How the market got there is more complex.Marlene K. Puffer, managing director of Twist Financial and a former finance lecturer at the University of Toronto, said the paper’s reputation as a safe way for companies and funds to park cash in the short term came from those who first issued it. When the paper initially became available in the late 1980s, it was sold by several of Canada’s large, and financially solid, chartered banks. The banks not only issued the paper, they also guaranteed it.“Implicitly, the assumption was that the banks would not walk away from their own paper,” she said.Seemingly secure, the commercial paper found lots of buyers. A series of multibillion-dollar annual Canadian government budget surpluses meant that Ottawa issued little or no short-term government debt. The asset-backed commercial paper quickly filled a void for some investors, and predictably, third parties like Coventree began competing with the banks as issuers.The current crisis has shown that those third-party issuers rely on mostly foreign banks as a backstop. With limited exposure in Canada, those banks generally have little to lose by refusing to declare a general market disruption to support the commercial paper. (Unlike this third-party paper, the market for commercial paper issued by Canadian banks remains healthy and active.)The potential that banks might not support third-party paper, Ms. Puffer said, was no secret. But the credit ratings applied by DBRS, she said, generally overcame investor concerns."
44,"LONDON —Knight Vinke Asset Management, an activist investor with a track record of successfully implementing changes at large companies around the world, has found its latest target in HSBC Holdings, Europe's biggest bank.But the investment firm, based in New York and Monaco, has failed so far to specify what kind of changes it would like to see at HSBC, whose shares have outperformed those of its British peers this year. That has left many analysts and shareholders baffled about the timing and purpose of the demands.""Until they come out with exactly what they are worried about, it's hard to see what they're on about,"" said Ed Collins, a fund manager at New Star Asset Management in London whose investments include HSBC shares. ""I trust the management. They were among the first to identify and deal with subprime exposure and if I invest in a bank, I'd like to see one with a good geographical spread, which HSBC has.""Eric Knight, chief executive of Knight Vinke, wrote to HSBC's board on Tuesday requesting ""a fundamental review of the group's strategy in consultation with shareholders.""About three months earlier, Knight Vinke, which is backed by Calpers, the activist California state pension fund, had written a letter to Stephen Green, HSBC's executive chairman, raising ""important governance-related concerns."" The letter was followed by a meeting in New York with Douglas Flint, the group's finance director.HSBC earlier this year was the target of shareholder discontent when the bank had to set aside £1.75 billion, or $3.5 billion, for losses on subprime mortgages in the United States, triggering the first profit warning in the bank's recent history.Shareholders also have complained that investment in its investment banking business had failed to show the expected results. And they have voiced discontent over Green's promotion to executive chairman from chief executive, a move widely seen in Britain as going against good corporate governance practice. There were also calls for the bank to sell businesses in developing countries and to expand further in faster-growing emerging markets.But some analysts said HSBC has already started to address most of these issues. It has managed to so far contain its U.S. subprime mortgage losses and in July reported first-half earnings that beat analysts' expectations.In the past week, it agreed to take a controlling stake in Korea Exchange Bank, a South Korean lender, for $6.3 billion as part of its emerging markets expansion. As a lender to money markets, HSBC also has liquidity and is therefore on ""the right side of the fence"" in the current financial market crisis, said James Hudson, a banking analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in London.This led some analysts, including Hudson, to question the timing of the Knight Vinke approach. ""You're attacking a bank at a time when factors are quite supportive of it,"" Hudson said.Timing is essential for shareholder activists, as illustrated by the failed attempt this year by a different group to force Vodafone Group, the world's largest cellphone company, to spin off its stake in a U.S. unit and return billions to investors. A majority of shareholders had voted against the proposals, saying that they would not have increased the share price.Richard Lindsay, a spokesman for HSBC in London, said that HSBC does take the opinion of shareholders seriously and is ""happy to have a dialogue."" But he added that the bank has a ""clear and well-understood strategy."" HSBC shares fell 1.6 percent to £8.73 in London on Friday.Martin Forrest, a spokesman for Knight Vinke, did not return calls or e-mails requesting comment.Previous battles by Knight Vinke include one last year in favor of a breakup of Suez, the French utility."
45,"MANILA —Economy - and optimism - on the rise in PhilippinesA year ago, Bernadette Sembrano took a gamble.Using her savings and some money borrowed from the bank, she bought a piece of land in a middle-class suburb here and built two rows of townhouses on it.She intended to sell the units to overseas Filipino workers, the main drivers of a property boom in this island nation of 85 million. But so far she has only found one buyer for the eight units.""I am such an optimist,"" said Sembrano, who works days as a television journalist.Her optimism is widespread in the Philippines these days, where the government last week reported that the economy grew at an annual rate of 7.5 percent in the second quarter, the fastest rate in 20 years. It is a remarkable event for a country plagued by political scandals and military mutinies - two perennial problems that have prevented the country from emerging from an economic rut.Stronger economic growth is already changing the lives of many ordinary citizens, who have new jobs and see bridges and roads springing up.There are doubts about the true vigor of the economy - related to increased government spending ahead of an election and the sustainability of fiscal overhauls.And, like elsewhere in Southeast Asia, the Philippines is vulnerable to a possible slowdown in the U.S. economy if problems in the housing market begin to spill over into other sectors.But for a country that has seen so much turmoil and poverty since the 1970s, the Philippines' recent economic resurgence, however fragile, has nevertheless been a welcome surprise to economists.President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, a U.S.-educated economist, has taken credit for much of this, having implemented measures - she imposed higher taxes and improved revenue collections, to name two - that her political opponents and critics relentlessly questioned and opposed.""While our economy has reached a new level of maturity and stability with one of the strongest macroeconomic fundamentals in two decades, we should not rest,"" Arroyo said after the release of the latest growth figures. ""We're the only administration that has not experienced negative growth in any quarter. ""One person benefiting is Alisa Lugar-Escanlar, 31, who quit her job as a restaurant manager early this year and applied as a call-center agent at eTelecare Global Solutions, one of the country's largest call-center companies.She is happily riding out a boom in the Philippines' growing services sector, which makes up half the economy and grew 8.4 percent in the second quarter.Outsourcing services are transforming the lives of thousands of Filipinos in ways not seen in the past three decades.Call centers have been credited with reducing the number of unemployed and creating a new class of moneyed, mostly young Filipinos. The Asian Development Bank estimated that 11 percent of those entering the labor force up to 2010 would be hired by call centers.""I didn't want to work in a call center at first but I tried it and realized that I liked it better than my old job,"" Escanlar said. Her life, she said, has been much better since then because she and her husband are now able to save money and buy more.One of the most visible areas of growth is public construction, which grew at an annual rate of 39.6 percent in the second quarter. New bridges and roads are everywhere, particularly in the capital.Although the government admitted that the rise in public infrastructure spending is linked to election spending in May, Arroyo emphasized last week that funding for infrastructure was ""in the front line in our campaign to reduce poverty.""Such spending could continue, said Luz Lorenzo, an economist at ATR Kim Eng Securities in Manila. ""Who is doing the spending? The government,"" Lorenzo said. ""Will it stop? No. Do they need to borrow money? No, because most of these are domestically financed.""The optimism has also given a lift to the stock market, attracting ordinary individual investors for the first time.Phillip Hagedorn, president of the Mutual Fund Management Company of the Philippines, called the increase in retail investors ""unprecedented,"" which he said indicated a growing confidence in the market among Filipinos.The benchmark stock index in the Philippines is up 11 percent so far this year, compared to a 23 percent gain for Vietnam and a 23 percent rise for Thailand. China's CSI 300 index is up 164 percent this year.Arroyo said last week that the challenge now is to ensure that this growth trickles down to the poorest Filipinos, many of whom are skeptical about the government's pronouncements of development.""My life, as well as that of my family, certainly has not improved,"" said Maricel Sevillano, a 21-year-old farmers' daughter who moved to Manila after her parents' death five years ago and has been working as a housemaid since. Three other sisters are also working as maids. Unable to finish high school, Sevillano left Bukidnon Province, in the south, to try her luck in Manila - a familiar story among poor Filipinos.Indeed, much of the skepticism toward Arroyo and her administration has to do with the myriad of problems the country continues to face.Average income is less than $2 a day. Health care is meager, with malnutrition still among the leading causes of death among children and infants. Forty-seven percent of Filipinos rate themselves as poor, according to the Social Weather Stations, a Manila research institute.On top of these problems, the country is saddled with communist and Islamic insurgencies that are driving away investment.Although some major companies, like Texas Instruments, have chosen the country over China or Vietnam, wariness remains among investors, mainly because there is still much to be done.""Power cost remains expensive. Infrastructure should also be developed; ports such as airports and seaports and expressways are not yet completed,"" Toshifumi Inami, president of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Philippines, told reporters last week. He pointed out that in the last five years, the number of Japanese companies in the Philippines remained unchanged, at 550.Arroyo appears aware of the need to attract investors. ""Her mantra nowadays is 'Invest. Invest. Invest,' "" her press secretary, Ignacio Bunye, said Monday.Defaults on risky mortgages in the United States have been sending shivers throughout global financial markets, affecting places as far away as here. In August, nervous foreign investors - in an apparent effort to shield themselves from potentially risky emerging market economies - sold Philippine stocks and other assets, making the country's peso the worst-performing of Asia's 10 most actively traded currencies, according to Bloomberg.The U.S. subprime crisis is beginning to spook some property developers here, too. At least one developer, Landco Pacific, disclosed last week that more than half of the revenues from its projects in the Philippines were from Filipinos working abroad, most of them in the United States.""The trouble is, it seems nobody has an idea how big this thing is and where it is headed,"" said Landco's chief operating officer, Francis Ceballos. ""There's a lot of uncertainty. What we have right now is an uneasy calm.""The Philippines - like neighboring Thailand and Indonesia - is largely dependent on exports, with most of them going to the United States, Japan and China. Volatile oil prices and a potential slowdown of the U.S. economy pose risks to the economy here, the government said.Sembrano, the television journalist who still has seven townhouses for sale, said that she honestly believes things will get better. But even she admits, ""Building the property was the easy part"" - selling it was another matter."
46,"SINCE this decade began, the United States has fought two wars, gone through one recession, endured the collapse of a bubble in technology stocks and is living through a crisis in subprime mortgages that is making it difficult for many people and companies to borrow money.And the stock market has gone, well, nowhere.The Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks ended the 1990s at 1,469.25. It ended August at 1,473.99, a gain of three-tenths of 1 percent.Looking at price movements by themselves can be misleading. To get a fuller picture, one should consider both the total return — assuming dividends are reinvested — and the corrosive effects of inflation.As is shown in the accompanying chart, the simple price return so far in this decade is the worst since the 1930s, when the Great Depression occurred. But the inflation-adjusted figure for total return is actually worse than in the 1930s, when a combination of deflation and high dividends from those companies that survived the Depression bolstered returns.But it is better than in the 1970s, when high inflation wiped out the apparent gains in share prices. On an inflation-adjusted basis, an investor in the S.& P. 500 is down 8.1 percent in this decade, or 1 percent a year, compared with a decline of 1.5 percent a year in the 1970s.The charts show the progression of stock market returns through the decade since the new century began — big losses in 2001 and 2002, followed by recoveries.The inflation adjustment is based on the Consumer Price Index, which is a widely followed but imperfect measure of inflation. The other charts show how the stock market has fared during the decade measured against values of other things that most people buy — and that have done very well in this decade.The first is wheat. At the end of 1999, wheat futures were trading at $2.48 a bushel. By the end of August, that price was up to $7.67, as demand from India helped to send prices to record highs. Even after adding all the dividends received since the end of 1999, stocks bought then are worth 63 percent fewer bushels of wheat than they were.A similar story is told in oil, where a barrel cost a bit over $25 as the 1990s ended, and nearly three times as much now. Measured in oil, stocks are down 61 percent. Gold has gone from under $300 an ounce to well over twice that figure. Measured in gold, stocks have lost half their value.The calculation for home prices is based on the government’s report on the median price of new homes. That is an inexact figure at best, because it does not take into account the size of new homes or the proportion built in relatively high-cost areas. But by that measure, stocks are down 22 percent, despite the recent decline in home prices. Had other measures been used, like the S.& P./Case-Shiller index of home prices, the decline in stock values would have appeared greater.To some extent, the stock market woes reflect a case of “what goes up must come down,” or, in the terms preferred by statisticians, a “reversion to mean.”Share prices outperformed oil, wheat, gold and home prices in both the 1980s and 1990s. And the rise of share prices in those decades left the prices at historically high valuations."

Had other measures been used, such as the S&P/Case-Shiller index of home prices, the decline in stock values would have appeared greater.To some extent, the current stock market woes reflect a case of ""what goes up must come down"" - or, in the terms preferred by statisticians, a ""reversion to mean."" Share prices outperformed oil, wheat, gold and home prices in both the 1980s and 1990s. And the rise of share prices in those decades left the prices at historically high valuations."
