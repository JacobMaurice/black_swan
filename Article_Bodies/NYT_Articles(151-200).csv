0,"SINGAPORE —Stocks in Asia and Europe resumed their slide Wednesday after the largest bank in Japan disclosed losses on investments linked to U.S. subprime mortgages, exacerbating investors' fears that U.S. credit problems are spreading across the globe.Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group said it lost about $43 million as of last month on investments connected to risky U.S. home loans. That news prompted the Nikkei 225 stock average in Japan to fall by almost 2.2 percent to its lowest point in nine months, extending the latest tumble on Wall Street that began on Tuesday.Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia and Taiwan fell by 3 percent or more. But the continuing rout of equity markets on concerns about tightening global credit turned the brunt of its impact Wednesday on Indonesia, where stocks fell almost 6 percent. (Page 12)The hunt was on for icebergs in Asian financial markets. Analysts and economists were assuring investors that Asia's exposure to the worsening mortgage loan market in the United States was too low to worry about.They say Asia's cash horde could withstand the exodus of investors whose exposure is worrisome, and that Asia's economic momentum can survive lower spending by American consumers.But investors were still anxious that somehow, somewhere, the credit cave-in taking place in Europe and the United States will eventually claim a big victim in Asia.""You never know: All of a sudden something could come out of the blue,"" said Hans Goetti, an investment strategist at Citi Global Wealth Management in Singapore.Perhaps the biggest trigger setting off the Wednesday slide in stock prices was news that the giant U.S. retail chains Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot had reported disappointing earnings for the second quarter and predicted an even bumpier year ahead because of higher energy costs and a sagging housing market.That news sent the Dow Jones industrial average down almost 2 percent Tuesday, and it resonated throughout Asia, stoking investor concerns that the U.S. housing slump could hurt demand for Asian exports.Economists disagree over the extent to which Asia is still dependent on U.S. export demand, though most concur that a significant decline in U.S. retail spending would hurt Asia.Stocks in China continue to rise nonetheless, despite an unfolding scandal over tainted food products and the recall by Mattel and other toy makers of products made in China.But in Hong Kong, shares of exporters like Li & Fung dropped along with the Hang Seng China enterprises index, which tracks 41 mainland companies.In Japan, shares in Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial fell to their lowest level in two years after the two banks reported losing several billion yen due to the declines in the U.S. subprime market.Mitsubishi UFJ said it had unrealized losses of about ¥5 billion, or $42.6 million. Sumitomo Mitsui said it had sold about ¥350 billion in U.S. mortgage-backed securities, suffering losses of several billions of yen as a result.Declines in Tokyo were exacerbated by the fact that many domestic investors, who have been steadily buying Japanese shares recently, were away for Japan's traditional mid-August Buddhist holidays, according to Ed Merner, who manages the Atlantis Japan Growth Fund in Tokyo.""A lot of people are panicking,"" said Merner.What concerns many investors in Asia now is not the direct exposure institutions may have to the U.S. subprime market, but rather their overall exposure to credit derivatives like collateralized debt obligations that have become less valuable as subprime concerns send interest rates higher.""It's simply not known to what extent Asian institutions are exposed to CDOs,"" said Goetti, at Citi.As a percentage of their overall assets, the losses reported by banks in Asia so far have been tiny. Analysts say the fallout is widening, however, as the implosion of credit emanating from the United States reverberates through credit markets worldwide.Even for banks and other institutions with little or no subprime exposure, the U.S. subprime mess is forcing up short-term interest rates. This is particularly harmful to lenders borrowing short-term to make long-term loans, which is what happened to the Australian mortgage lender Rams Home Loans Group, according to Ben Zucker, an analyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Rams said Tuesday that the situation in U.S. markets was forcing it to pay more to cover its financing, potentially hurting earnings. Rams does not invest in U.S. mortgage loans or lend money to American homeowners, but it had been taking out loans of less than a year in order to lend out mortgages that can run for as long as 25 years, Zucker said.Most banks do not have to worry about rising short-term borrowing costs, Zucker said. They have alternative source of capital, such as deposits, and can easily pass along higher funding costs to borrowers.But rising short-term borrowing costs could hit companies with heavy borrowings, he said. ""This is the next stage contagion that's coming out - the repricing of risk occurring in the corporate debt market,"" said Zucker.The good news in Asia is that most corporations have significantly less debt than their counterparts elsewhere in the world, a legacy of the Asian financial crisis a decade ago.""Companies had a phobia for debt after the Asian crisis,"" said Paul Schulte, Asian regional strategist at Lehman Brothers in Hong Kong.As a result, he said, Asian corporations have $350 billion of cash on their balance sheets. Over all, Asia has roughly $2.3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves, an increasing amount of which is being invested within the region as central banks try to diversify away from U.S. Treasury securities and the declining U.S. dollar.With inflation now rising faster than real interest rates, Asia's central bankers and corporate treasurers managers are under pressure to put that cash to work.As the U.S. crisis unfolds, Schulte said, that could give rise to an interesting situation: ""Asia can now go on the hunt for busted-up assets in the States,"" he said, just as American investors sought to buy up distressed Asia assets in the wake of its financial crisis.""Boy, how the tables have turned,"" he said."
1,"NEW YORK —Turmoil in the subprime mortgage market has spread again - this time to a type of short-term security held by money-market mutual funds. These funds have become the investment of choice for many people seeking a safe haven.Standard & Poor's, the ratings agency, warned Tuesday that it might downgrade several issuers of commercial paper, a short-term i.o.u. issued by companies that promise to repay the loans, typically within a few weeks to a year.In these cases, Standard & Poor's said, the commercial paper was backed by residential mortgages.The amount of commercial paper in the United States has grown to $2.2 trillion, according to Lehman Brothers, with about $1.2 trillion backed by residential mortgages, credit card receivables, car loans and other bonds. The major buyers include pension funds, insurance companies, hedge funds and short-term money market funds.Investors have flocked to money market funds to avoid volatile stocks and the seized-up bond market. Last week, more than $36 billion moved into money market funds, the largest shift since December 2005.In all, $2.6 trillion is in money market funds, according to AMG Data Services.Such funds are sold to investors as the equivalent of cash, and their $1-a-share net asset value is viewed as inviolate. But if the funds experienced enough losses, the value of their assets could be vulnerable.Standard & Poor's acted a day after a $1.6 billion cash-management fund run by Sentinel Management Group halted redemptions because it could not sell its assets at what it considered acceptable prices.Until recently, the crisis in the credit markets has been limited to problems related to subprime mortgages, those given to borrowers with questionable credit histories. But as these troubles seep into other parts of the securities markets, fears of losses are rising in unexpected places.Companies that issue asset-backed commercial paper - the borrowers - have found it highly profitable. These companies have typically used the money they borrow to buy securities - slices of mortgage pools, for example - that generated yields much higher than the interest rates they paid to the short-term lenders.But there are risks: First, the companies that issue short-term notes backed by assets with considerably longer terms are exposing themselves to the risk that the interest rates they earn will not exceed the amount they must pay to their lenders. Perhaps more significantly, the borrowers must be concerned about possible losses in the assets they buy, especially when investors will no longer lend them money by purchasing their commercial paper.Standard & Poor's highlighted four commercial paper issuers for possible downgrades. Broadhollow Funding, which was set up by American Home Mortgage Investment, a lender that filed for bankruptcy last week; KKR Atlantic Funding Trust and KKR Pacific Funding Trust, two affiliates of the buyout firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts; and Ottimo Funding, an affiliate of Aladdin Capital Management, an investment manager in Stamford, ConnecticutKKR declined to comment Tuesday.Ottimo Funding holds about $3 billion in residential mortgages, all rated AAA. George Marshman, chief investment officer at Aladdin , said: ""It's a negotiation process. We're working with all the investors to make things as orderly as possible. I'm optimistic we can get a good outcome.""Among the money market funds that held commercial paper issued by the companies singled out for possible downgrade were two offered by Evergreen Investments. The $16.6 billion Evergreen Institutional Money Market Fund held $385 million in Broadhollow Funding and $72 million in Ottimo Funding, as of last May. The $4.5 billion Evergreen Prime Cash Management Money Market Fund held $50 million in Ottimo Funding as well.A spokeswoman for Evergreen declined to comment.Legg Mason's Master Portfolio Trust Liquid Reserves Portfolio, a $52.5 billion fund, owned almost $200 million in securities issued by Ottimo Funding and $750 million in KKR Atlantic Funding.Mary Athridge, a Legg Mason spokeswoman, said: ""The holdings represent less than 1.4 percent of the portfolio. We believe the current disruption in the marketplace is liquidity-related rather than credit-related, which the Fed has stepped into the market to address.""As of May 31, Columbia Funds Series Trust Cash Reserves, a $62 billion fund, had a $120 million stake in Ottimo Funding and $400 million in KKR Pacific Funding Trust. A Columbia Management spokesman did not return calls requesting comment.""If the stigma of mortgage-related extendable-asset-backed commercial paper spreads to asset-backed commercial paper as a whole, you could see bailout events,"" said Peter Crane, president of Crane Data, the publisher of Money Fund Intelligence, a newsletter about money market mutual funds. But he added: ""The stuff that the money funds are invested in are the highest quality, so it's the last thing to have trouble.""But investment strategies that once were considered conservative no longer are.The Sentinel fund that banned redemptions Monday advertised itself as risk-averse. In a letter to investors, Sentinel said that it had hoped to ride out the troubles but was unable to do so.""We are concerned that we cannot meet any significant redemption requests without selling securities at deep discounts to their fair value and therefore causing unnecessary losses to our clients,"" the letter said. ""We will continue to monitor the markets and we will raise cash as opportunities present themselves.""Sentinel officials did not return calls seeking comment.Douglas Kass, a general partner of Seabreeze Partners Management, an investment firm in Palm Beach, Florida, said the Sentinel disclosure and upheaval in commercial paper markets is an example of the risk investors take when they reach for higher yields. ""This is symptomatic of a whole body of investors, including money market and cash management funds, that are attempting to enhance yields and this is the downside to that journey,"" he said."

3,"Stocks staged a late rally today on Wall Street after a day of wild swings as investors continued to weigh the impact of the crunch in the American credit market.Shortly after noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was off by more than 340 points, or 2.6 percent, following big declines in Asian and European trading. But after reversing field several times, the market recovered its losses in the final hour.At the close, the Dow was off 15.69 points for the day, or 0.1 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was showing a gain, and the Nasdaq composite was down only slightly.“It was a pretty remarkable turn, and I don’t think anybody can really make sense of it,” said Tobias M. Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. “It’s not about any fundamental development because we didn’t get any news today that would push you any one way or another.”In the course of the day, all three indexes were showing losses of more than 10 percent since their peak last month — the threshold at which the market’s fall is considered to have reached a correction. But by the close, they had escaped that territory.The upheaval came amid a bruising week for stocks, and a day after the market plunged in the final hour of trading, with the Dow closing off 167 points and the S.& P. 500 erasing its own gains for the year.That set the tone for a wild ride in foreign financial markets overnight. The main stock indexes in nearly every developed nation around the world closed lower or were headed toward finishing the day in the red.The sell-off on Wall Street was so steep that at 12:01 p.m., the New York Stock Exchange imposed limits on automated program trading, known as a circuit breaker, a move intended to prevent bigger declines.Even with the late rally, share values of blue-chip companies like Apple, Exxon Mobil, Boeing and I.B.M. still suffered significant losses.Adding to an already tense environment, more problems became apparent in the mortgage market today. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, said it had tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world’s largest banks, as it seeks to shore up its cash position.The company, which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street, acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it may have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide. Shares of the company closed down 11 percent, after falling 13 percent yesterday. The stock is down more than 50 percent for the year.In a statement released early this morning, the company also said that 90 percent of the home loans it will now make will be to standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgage loans, because it is not able to sell them to other buyers.The reversal of fortune in the housing market was further illustrated by figures released by the Commerce Department today that showed the rates of construction of new homes and building permits issued fell in July to their lowest levels in more than a decade.A move by the Federal Reserve intended to calm the markets seemed to have little impact at first. The Fed injected $17 billion into the system this morning in two open-market actions by lending against mortgage securities.Whether the turbulence in financial markets will have larger ramifications for the American economy is still unclear. Many economists, including those at the Fed, have said they believe the damage will remain contained. With each day of turmoil in the markets, however, the outlook becomes more and more murky.Henry Paulson, the Treasury secretary, told The Wall Street Journal in an interview published today that market troubles “will extract a penalty” on economic growth, but he said he did not believe a recession was likely.The market tumult seemed to put a dent in oil prices today. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil futures contracts declined even as two tropical disturbances grew more powerful in the Atlantic.In Europe today, the FTSE-100 in London closed down more than 4 percent, while the CAC-40 of France dropped 3.3 percent and the DAX in Germany was down more than 2 percent. The Asian slump was led by a nearly 7 percent decline in South Korea as nervousness spreading there from finance professionals to ordinary small investors.“The psychology is shifting notably today,” said David Bowers, a global strategist at Absolute Strategy Research in London. “When a market drops by 10 percent, people start to feel it in their portfolios. People are used to stock markets behaving in a non-volatile and even bullish manner.”In Europe, shares of banking stocks were hard-hit as equity markets retreated. The worst-hit included BNP Paribas, which last week sparked a market rout when it revealed it had frozen three funds in subprime mortgages had been invested. Shares were down 2.9 percent at midday. ABN Amro, the target of a takeover battle that would create the world’s largest bank, fell 1.3 percent at midday.And fears that the credit crunch might make it harder to finance deals hit the Dutch chemicals group Akzo Nobel, whose shares slid 3.1 percent midday on concerns that Henkel, its partner in the takeover of Britain’s ICI would have trouble financing its part of the deal, Reuters reported.Concerns are beginning to mount that the subprime crisis may generate a consumer pullback in the United States, triggering an economic slowdown that may hit America’s export partners.“Although today will likely again be dominated by concerns over credit markets, at some point the concerns will move to consumer confidence, consumption and the global economy,” ABN Amro said in a note to clients.The losses reverberated most sharply in Asia, where investors were also shaken after Rams Home Loans Group of Australia, a nonbank lender which earlier in the week warned that its earnings could be hurt by rising costs for its U.S. borrowings, confirmed Thursday that it had been unable to refinance $5 billion in debt.“It’s a kind of a panic among individual investors,” said Cho Hong Rae, head of research at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul, adding that domestic retail investors had up until today generally been buying shares as they declined.The South Korean benchmark stock index suffered its biggest decline in more than five years today, falling nearly 7 percent late in the afternoon in Asia after an initial 10 percent plunge that forced the Korea Exchange to suspend trading for 20 minutes.Similar declines occurred in Indonesia and the Philippines, where stocks also fell by roughly 7.7 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Declines in the region’s other big markets were less severe, but still dramatic: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell by about 2 percent; and Hong Kong’s benchmark dropped by about 3.5 percent.Chinese stocks were lower too. During recent trading sessions, they have brushed off drops in other parts of the world.Analysts in Australia said Rams’s problems were unlikely to have much effect on the country’s banks, because they do not rely significantly on borrowing from the United States.“In the end the impact on them will not be so severe,” said Ben Zucker, an analyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Nonetheless, companies and financial institutions that had taken advantage of a booming American appetite for debt to borrow United States dollars cheaply and fund costs at home in Australia where the currency has been appreciating are likely to suffer a sudden whiplash effect now as interest rates rise and the United States dollar regains ground, he said.In South Korea, Mr. Cho said that most domestic selling was still by individuals trying to unload individual stocks. So far, he said, local mutual funds were not seeing a market increase in redemptions that would force them to join the selling. And automatic contributions to pension funds were still being made to big institutions, which were taking advantage of the latest declines to buy stocks more cheaply, he said."
4,"Stocks opened sharply lower on Wall Street today after a sell-off in Asia and heavy losses in Europe, the latest reverberations of the credit crunch stemming from the reversals in the American mortgage market.In the first five minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrial average was off 100 points, or 0.8 percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite were also down.The losses come a day after the Dow Jones industrial average plunged in the final hour of trading, closing off 167 points. Trading in stock index futures had presaged the further decline today amid signs of the Federal Reserve’s continued reluctance to cut rates in the midst of the markets’ turbulence.Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, today said it has tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world’s largest banks, as it seeks to shore up its cash position.The company, which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street, acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it may have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide. Shares of the company were down about 7 percent in pre-market trading, to $19.73, after falling 13 percent yesterday. The stock is down about 50 percent for the year.In a statement released early this morning, the company also said that 90 percent of the home loans it will now make will be to standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the big purchasers of mortgage loans, because it is not able to sell them to other buyers.“As we have previously discussed, secondary market demand for non-agency mortgage-backed securities has been disrupted in recent weeks,” David Sambol, the company’s president and chief operating officer, said in a statement.The reversal in fortune in the housing market was further illustrated by figures released by the Commerce Department today that showed construction of new homes fell in July to the lowest level in more than a decade, dropping 6.1 percent last month.The Wall Street declines came after stocks in Asia continued their downward spiral, led by shares in South Korea, as local investors returned from a national holiday there and joined the stampede by foreign investors trying to sell.Across Europe, markets were also sustaining heavy losses in early trading.“It’s a kind of a panic among individual investors,” said Cho Hong Rae, head of research at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul, adding that domestic retail investors had up until today generally been buying shares as they declined.The South Korean benchmark stock index suffered its biggest decline in more than five years today, falling nearly 7 percent late in the afternoon in Asia after an initial 10 percent plunge that forced the Korea Exchange to suspend trading for 20 minutes.Similar declines occurred in Indonesia and the Philippines, where stocks also fell by roughly 7.7 percent and 6 percent, respectively. Declines in the region’s other big markets were less severe, but still dramatic: Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fell by about 2 percent; and Hong Kong’s benchmark dropped by about 3.5 percent.Chinese stocks were lower too. During recent trading sessions, they have brushed off drops in other parts of the world.Australia was also hit today by more repercussions from the credit crisis in the United States. Rams Home Loans Group, a nonbank lender which earlier in the week warned that its earnings could be hurt by rising costs for its United States borrowings, confirmed today that it had been unable to refinance $5 billion in debt.Analysts in Australia said Rams’s problems were unlikely to have much effect on the country’s banks, because they do not rely significantly on borrowing from the United States.“In the end the impact on them will not be so severe,” said Ben Zucker, an analyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Nonetheless, companies and financial institutions that had taken advantage of a booming American appetite for debt to borrow United States dollars cheaply and fund costs at home in Australia where the currency has been appreciating are likely to suffer a sudden whiplash effect now as interest rates rise and the United States dollar regains ground, he said.In South Korea, Mr. Cho said that most domestic selling was still by individuals trying to unload individual stocks. So far, he said, local mutual funds were not seeing a market increase in redemptions that would force them to join the selling. And automatic contributions to pension funds were still being made to big institutions, which were taking advantage of the latest declines to buy stocks more cheaply, he said.Mr. Cho said that Korean financial institutions, like others around Asia, had only small direct exposures to United States subprime mortgages. Having suffered through the Asian financial crisis and a similar blowout in personal debts in 2002, Korean banks have become relatively conservative, he said.So have Korean regulators, who Mr. Cho said have been putting the brakes on the property market by boosting restrictions on how much banks can lend for property investments.As a result, Mr. Cho said, property prices have stagnated, but borrowers are less likely to default because they took on too much debt.But the same might not hold true of Korean companies. In a report last month examining the creditworthiness of Asian companies, Lehman Brothers strategist Paul Schulte observed that some of the biggest gains by Korean stocks had come in shares of companies with a high reliance on debt financing.A somewhat brighter picture has emerged in Australia. Notwithstanding Rams’s predicament, which was caused by its borrowing, the quality of mortgages in Australia has been steadily improving, according to Mr. Zucker. After several years of slumping prices in big eastern markets like Sydney and Melbourne, prices are now picking up. With joblessness at record lows and Australian economic growth quickening, banks still appear to be on solid footing, he said.Shortly after the open in Europe, London’s FTSE 100 was down about 2 percent to 5,982.60; in Frankfurt, Germany, the Dax Index was down about 2 percent to 7,299.79; and markets in Stockholm, Madrid and Milan were also down about 2 percent.In the United States, the decline in the stock index futures follows comments from William Poole, St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank president, after Wednesday’s stock market close. He said that the market turmoil has not undermined the United States economy and there is no need for an inter-meeting rate cute, Reuters reported."
5,"BOSTON —When the Boston hedge fund millionaire Jeffrey Larson visited a classroom of economics students at his Midwestern alma mater last year, he picked up a marker and diagrammed a low-risk strategy for maximizing profits when investing in a company's stocks and bonds.The probability ""of success was exceedingly high,"" remembered Karl Egge, a professor who had taught Larson in the late 1970s and had invited him back to his class at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota.And at the time, Larson's investment strategy was working, with a 16 percent return from June 2005 to June 2006, nearly double what stocks returned in that period. But a month ago, Larson's supposedly seaworthy $3 billion hedge fund at Sowood Capital Management in Boston abruptly foundered in turbulent debt markets.His loss of $1.6 billion of investors' money is the biggest hedge fund collapse this year. Much of it occurred during a few frantic days in July, when a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market triggered a shock wave that caused the values of many debt securities, such as those held by Sowood, to drop sharply. Larson suddenly did not have enough money to repay his lenders, and he was forced to dissolve the fund. He sold off the remnants and closed Sowood on July 30.Larson's sudden fall has left investors, colleagues and friends wondering how a prudent Midwesterner from River Falls, Wisconsin (population 14,000) - who came east and starred as a highly paid investment manager for Harvard University until he launched Sowood three years ago - could have miscalculated so badly.Hedge funds have earned a reputation for making elaborate bets on securities as straightforward as stocks, as well as more complicated currency and commodity trades that can earn their managers amazing sums. The most successful hedge fund managers earned more than $1 billion in 2005, according to a survey by Alpha magazine. Average pay for the top 25 in 2005 was $323 million.Because of the risky and sometimes opaque nature of their strategies, hedge funds are off-limits to all but the most sophisticated and well-heeled of investors - pension funds, for example, or families rich enough to pony up the $5 million or so entry fee typical at some shops.Friends and colleagues said Larson, 49, never fit the stereotype of a swaggering hedge fund cowboy or reckless financial raider. A friend said he is the antithesis of the corporate villain portrayed in the 1987 movie ""Wall Street.""""Not every hedge fund manager is Gordon Gekko,"" said one friend, Jonathon Jacobson, Larson's former colleague at Harvard Management, which manages Harvard's endowment. Jacobson co-founded the Boston investment firm Highfields Capital Management.""Until the last six weeks, Jeff had an impeccable 25-year career,"" he said. ""Virtually everyone I have spoken to feels horrible for Sowood's clients and employees, but most of all for Jeff. And believe me, no one feels worse about what happened than he does.""Larson has refused numerous requests for interviews and also declined to answer e-mailed questions. He has issued two brief statements in which he apologized to Sowood's investors, but otherwise has not provided a detailed explanation of its collapse.Sowood's strategies involved exploiting differences in prices between a company's bond, notes and other loans, and its stock. He would buy these debt securities of a company in the hope those values would rise, then hedge that bet by short-selling its stock, which would pay off if share prices fell. That way, if he gambled wrong on the bond position, Larson would be able to recover or limit those losses if and when its stock price also fell.Daniel Koelsch, a hedge fund specialist at Standard & Poor's, said Sowood's investment strategy was neither uncommon on Wall Street nor excessively risky.Rather, what did Larson in was how he funded that strategy. Like many other hedge funds, Sowood borrowed heavily to finance its investments, Koelsch and other specialists said. By making more money available to invest, such a leverage strategy can amplify returns for investors, yielding bigger fees for fund managers.But in Sowood's case, Koelsch said, it appeared Larson's fundamental problem was not having enough cash or liquid assets in case his bets went wrong and his lenders, as they ultimately did, demanded their money back.It's a difficult balancing act for hedge fund managers seeking to maximize returns, said Timothy Mungovan, an attorney in the Boston office of Nixon Peabody who specializes in alternative investments, such as hedge funds.The overreliance on leverage is an echo of 1998, when the $4 billion collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management prompted federal banking regulators to engineer an unusual rescue plan. For both Long Term Capital and Sowood, the magnitude of losses was caused by the same market phenomenon: a blizzard of bond or debt investments that were in low demand and quickly falling in value.After graduating from Macalester in 1979, Larson worked as a trader for the agricultural commodities firm Cargill, and was promoted to its London office to trade in foreign securities. There he formed ties to investment brokers who helped him make the leap in 1991 to the rarefied halls of Harvard Management, which invests the university's $29 billion endowment.Working under the legendary Harvard endowment manager Jack Meyer, Larson became a top manager. He consistently beat market benchmarks by wide margins and, in turn, Harvard rewarded Larson handsomely.He made $17.4 million in 2002, putting him in the endowment's top echelon but also making him and other high-paid managers lightning rods for controversy. He was among an exodus of Harvard managers who left the firm earlier this decade amid a wave of criticism from faculty and alumni over the endowment's pay policies.He started Sowood in 2004, with Harvard staking him to $500 million. Sowood won other prestigious clients: the Massachusetts state employees pension fund and the philanthropic Boston Foundation.In late spring, the market for bonds and other debts issued by corporations was rocked by a crisis in U.S. subprime mortgages. As happens in routs, the market deteriorated in ways Larson failed to anticipate: Investors abandoned many forms of corporate debt, not just those related to the mortgage markets, and did so without regard to the underlying fundamentals of specific companies. The careful research Larson and his managers performed to pick strong companies didn't matter once investors made a mass exodus.As a result, Sowood's bond-related holdings plunged in value. Meanwhile, stocks that were supposed to fall - the hedge - didn't fall enough.The lenders who provided Larson with credit to place his heavily leveraged bets wanted their money back. Scrambling to raise money during the week of July 23, Larson could not sell his drastically devalued holdings fast enough. The more demand for these holdings dropped and they declined in value, the more he had to sell to raise cash, which in turn pushed their prices down even further.Within a week, this classic death spiral had claimed Larson's company. After a weekend of scrambling for a bailout, he announced on July 30, a Monday morning, that he was shuttering Sowood and selling its remaining holdings to Citadel Investment Group.Harvard's endowment lost $350 million; the Massachusetts pension fund $30 million and Boston Foundation close to $20 million."
6,"FRANKFURT —Stocks in Asia and Europe plunged Thursday for a second straight day, extending a sell-off that has gripped markets as credit fears stemming from the American mortgage market crisis has deepened.The market volatility brought calls by European officials for more scrutiny of financial markets and the ratings agencies responsible for assessing the risk of subprime debt.On Wall Street, the major stock indexes were down sharply most of the day, and the Dow Jones industrial average was down 343 points at one point, pulling the blue-chip index into a 10 percent drop from its July 19 record close of 14,000.41. But U.S. stocks rebounded in late trading Thursday, with the Dow closing down 15.69 points at 12,845.78, a drop of 8.2 percent from its peak.Asian markets, burned by Wall Street's sharp losses a day earlier, slumped Thursday as the Korean index slid nearly 7 percent, setting off a regional sell-off. Across Europe, major market indicators fell up to 4.1 percent.President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea urged investors not to overreact to the global financial market instability.""The psychology is shifting notably today,"" said David Bowers, a global strategist at Absolute Strategy Research in London. ""When a market drops by 10 percent, people start to feel it in their portfolios. People are used to stock markets behaving in a nonvolatile and even bullish manner.""President Nicolas Sarkozy of France urged the Group of 7 industrial countries to step up their monitoring of international financial markets, and his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said ministers could meet before their next regular meeting, set for October.The European Commission said it would seek greater scrutiny of ratings agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's, companies that have built lucrative businesses by providing credible ratings to companies and investment products, a call that was also joined by Sarkozy. The agencies stand accused of being slow to warn investors of problems in the subprime mortgage industry in the United States.""We have to ask ourselves the exact role rating agencies should play in mapping risks,"" Sarkozy said in letter, released Thursday, to Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, news services reported. ""Their role, which allies the creation of these products and the risk assessment, should be submitted to a careful examination.""Ratings agencies said they were cooperating with regulators.Suspicions that hidden losses from investments in subprime-related securities might pop up still loom large, making investors reluctant to fuel what only recently seemed like a bullish market.On Thursday, a Spanish fund, March Monetario Dinámico, announced it had limited withdrawals for around 3,000 investors due to effects from the world-wide credit squeeze, Reuters reported. The limitation on withdrawals from the €250 million, or $335 million, fund is in response to the freezing of a BNP Paribas fund. Citing subprime exposure, BNP Paribas, one of the largest French banks, froze €1.6 billion worth of funds last Thursday, leading to a sharp decline in financial markets.At the heart of the problem with subprime loans is the seized-up market for these securities, which are backed by risky mortgages that are now going sour.Very little trading of them is going on, making it difficult to fix a price. To remedy the situation, holders of these investments have to be willing or able to take losses, while buyers need to have the appetite for new risk - two developments that are likely to unfold slowly.""This process is likely to play out for the next three to six months,"" said Chris Mahoney, vice chairman of Moody's Investors Service.Against this backdrop, many investors wondered if the subprime crisis, now mostly confined to one sector of the U.S. economy, would spread and lead to slowdowns elsewhere in the world - two contingencies that seemed remote until very recently.""We are getting a lot of questions on these basic tenets of the economy,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs in London.The U.S. Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., told The Wall Street Journal that market turmoil ""will extract a penalty"" on U.S. growth, but said that the economy and financial markets were ""strong enough to absorb the losses."" That fact is helping to drive down stocks in emerging markets and Asia, two regions heavily reliant on exports to America, the world's largest economy.Lagarde of France offered a similar, if more narrow, assessment for France. ""We have every reason to feel confident about the situation of the French banking sector,"" Lagarde said, Reuters reported.The notion that sliding markets might become more common appeared to be sinking in as even smaller investors contemplated if now was the time to cut their losses. But evidence of widespread small-investor exodus appeared spotty, for now at least.""The majority of our investors seem to be holding tight at the moment,"" said Juliette Schooling, head of research for Chelsea Financial Services in London, which manages roughly £1 billion, or $1.98 billion, in investments for investors ranging from small savers to wealthy individuals.While Chelsea's fund managers have received some calls from concerned investors, she said, there did not seem to be any sense of panic. Some of that calm could be due to the fact that many people are away on summer vacations and not keeping close tabs on the market's recent gyrations, Schooling conceded.Countrywide Financial, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said Thursday it has tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world's largest banks, as it seeks to shore up its cash position, adding to worries on Wall Street.The company, which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street, acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it might have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide.International Herald TribuneWayne Arnold in Singapore, Choe Sang-Hun in Seoul, Heather Timmons in New Delhi and James Kanter and Nicola Clark in Paris contributed reporting."
7,"HONG KONG —With stock markets now plunging around the world on financial worries clearly marked ""made in U.S.A.,"" and with growing worries about an economic slowdown in the United States, Asian countries may soon discover whether they are really ready to cope with a diminished American role.Countries in the region, particularly China, have increasingly chafed in recent years at their dependence on the United States: the enormous demand of American consumers for imports, the dominance of the American dollar, the pervasive presence of American financial institutions.Fundamental economic changes do indeed seem to have limited somewhat the region's need for American consumers and financial markets, although the dependence remains considerable, business executives and economists agree.""Definitely the reliance on the U.S. economy, particularly from the Asian economies, has lessened a bit over the last five to seven years,"" said Sanjay Mehta, the chief executive of Essar Shipping and Logistics, an Indian shipping company. ""There will be an impact - I don't see that there will be no impact - but less of an impact than we saw in 2001 and 2002 when the Internet bubble crashed.""Many in Asia have been taking pride until lately in the extent to which the region has seemed to be weaning itself from reliance on the United States.At the Canton Trade Fair in April, executives from across China were enthusiastic about sales prospects in Europe, as China's exports to Europe surpassed its exports to the United States in February.In Baharbari, a small village of thatched huts at the end of a muddy track in northeastern India, most of the young men have left for jobs on housing construction sites in northwestern India, part of a broader boom in domestic demand across much of Asia.And in Bangkok, cement executives like Prachai Leophairatana exude confidence when talking about exports to Vietnam, part of a surge in commerce among East Asian nations that has made the region the world's fastest-growing center of trade.When the United States suffered its last slowdown six years ago, Asian exports went from 25 percent growth in 2000 to a 15 percent drop in 2002. But part of that plunge reflected the weakness of European and Japanese economies then, and these economies appear much stronger now.The spreading debacle in the United States seems to have damaged the country's image as a model of corporate governance and effective government regulation, and made Asian companies and regulators look more competent than they seemed a decade ago.During the humiliation of the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, the ""tiger"" economies of southeast Asia proved to be paper tigers with poor corporate governance and uncontrolled borrowing.Now the United States has the economy where financial regulation seems to have been weak and where consumers and businesses alike borrowed with little restraint.Even a modest downturn in housing prices in the United States seems to have hurt well-known American institutions like Bear Stearns.By contrast, real estate prices in Hong Kong plunged by two-thirds from 1997 to 2003, but the city's banking industry remained solidly profitable throughout thanks to tough regulations that prevented banks from lending more than 70 percent of the value of a home.The International Monetary Fund forbade Southeast Asian nations a decade ago from seeking economic recovery by closing their markets, but many business people in China now see the United States as pursuing this route, as it has limited Chinese apparel imports and begun challenges before the World Trade Organization against Chinese policies on auto parts and intellectual property protection.As businesses from Mizuho Financial Group in Japan to Rams Home Loan Group in Australia encounter problems with subprime mortgages written in the United States, a worried suspicion is emerging about a trans-Pacific financial link that may have been deeper than anyone realized: the United States may have been paying for a lot of its imports in recent years with mortgage securities of dubious value.""It's possible that the U.S. financial institutions are smart enough to have passed on the risk to Europe and elsewhere,"" said Li Kui-wai, the director of the Asian business research center at City University of Hong Kong.""The Asians do not trust the American economy any longer, America is not the engine of globalization any more - they are looking for a new engine and it might be China, it might be Europe but it's not the U.S.,"" said Frank-Jürgen Richter, a specialist in Asian economies who is the president of Horasis, a research group in Geneva.But while Asian economies may not need the United States as much as in the past, financial and commercial ties remain strong, and could prove a drag on the region.China is still more than 20 times as dependent on exports to the United States as a percentage of its total economic output as the United States is on exports to China.The bulk of Chinese exports to the United States involve products for which the components are largely imported from elsewhere in Asia, snapped together by rows of Chinese workers on long benches under fluorescent lights, and then re-exported.But a serious slowdown in such businesses, in which China supplies little more than cheap labor, could still result in large-scale layoffs.Yet the consequences as a share of Chinese economic output could be limited in a country where investment in roads, bridges, housing complexes and other fixed assets rose 26.6 percent in the first seven months of this year compared to the same period last year.While the dollar has temporarily strengthened against the euro and the pound as traders seek a safe haven from global financial troubles, it has tumbled this week against the yen and could fall more broadly if the housing debacle proves to have delivered a body blow to the entire American economy.A weak dollar would be a problem not just for Asian exporters, which would find it harder to compete in the American market, but also for Asian central banks, which have been the biggest buyers of dollars in recent years.The People's Bank of China keeps an estimated two-thirds of its $1.3 trillion foreign-exchange reserves in dollars, including what experts describe as what started as a $100 billion holding of American mortgage-backed securities that may have declined in value lately.Asian central banks sitting on losses will face a tough decision of whether to continue their policies of buying dollars to prop up the American currency and thereby sustain their own exports.If the dollar does drop, then Asia, as a region that still conducts much of its trade in dollars, could be in trouble. So the man most watched in Asia now is probably Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.""The Fed will be in a dilemma, to reduce the interest rate or let the economy slow - if you do reduce the interest rate, the dollar will fall,"" said Mehta, of Essar Shipping. ""That is a major worry for most of the people in Asia right now."""
8,"MELBOURNE —HFA Holdings, an Australian hedge fund manager that manages more than $3 billion, said Thursday that its funds had benefited from the turmoil in the U.S. subprime mortgage market.HFA anticipated the crisis in U.S. subprime mortgage securities as long as two years ago and short-sold the securities, it said in a statement. Short sellers are investors who borrow securities and then sell in the hope they can buy them back cheaper, pocketing the proceeds.HFA's gains contrast with Bear Stearns in the United States, which was forced to liquidate hedge funds.Three Sydney-based hedge funds - Basis Capital Funds Management, Absolute Capital Group and Mariner Bridge Investments - have also been hurt by the subprime fallout.""HFA got it right, and now they're reaping the reward, while others were not so lucky,"" said Karl Siegling, who manages about $86 million at Cadence Capital, a Sydney-based hedge fund manager. ""It's not all bad news for hedge funds because they can actually take advantage of bad markets.""HFA rose 11.52 percent, to 1.84 Australian dollars, on the stock exchange in Sydney, paring an earlier gain of as much as 18 percent, after the company delayed an agreement to buy the U.S. fund manager Lighthouse Partners for 707 million Australian dollars, or $572 million.The shares have slumped 43 percent since they reached a high of 3.00 dollars on July 25 amid the slide in global markets.The takeover, which would increase HFA's assets under management to about $8 billion and create a company with eight offices in Australia, Hong Kong, Britain and the United States, will proceed when the shares recover, HFA said in a separate statement Thursday.""It's a sensible thing to do given how far the shares have dropped since the credit crisis began,"" said Angus Gluskie, a fund manager at White Funds Management in Sydney.HFA said its investments in collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage backed securities resulted in a net short position.""Our investors will be well rewarded by their allocations to HFA's absolute return funds over the coming 12 months,"" the company said in a statement to the stocks exchange.Rams Home Loans Group, the first Australian home-loan company to say that profit may be hurt by the deepening credit crisis, said Thursday that it had been unable to refinance 6.17 billion dollars of short-term U.S. loans because of a ""lack of market liquidity"" caused by the global credit rout.Rams slumped 35.93 percent to 86 cents. It has lost about half its market value this week.Rams's statement follows bankruptcy filings in the United States by American Home Mortgage Investment and New Century Financial."

10,"Stocks plunged on Wall Street again Thursday in the latest reverberations of the crunch in the American credit market.At 1 p.m. in New York, the Dow Jones industrial average was down more than 330 points, or 2.5 percent. And the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite were down by comparable amounts, bringing the losses for all three indexes to more than 10 percent since their peak last month - the threshold at which the market's fall is considered to have reached a correction. The losses came a day after stocks plunged in the final hour of trading, with the Dow closing off 167 points and the S&P 500 erasing its own gains for the year.That set the tone for a wild ride in foreign financial markets overnight. The main stock indexes in nearly every developed nation around the world closed lower or were headed toward finishing the day in the red.""The psychology is shifting notably today,"" said David Bowers, a global strategist at Absolute Strategy Research in London. ""When a market drops by 10 percent, people start to feel it in their portfolios. People are used to stock markets behaving in a non-volatile and even bullish manner.""Countrywide Financial, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said Thursday it has tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world's largest banks, as it seeks to shore up its cash position.The company, which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street, acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it may have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide. Shares of the company were down about 7 percent in pre-market trading, to $19.73, after falling 13 percent yesterday. The stock is down about 50 percent for the year.Overseas, the market turmoil reverberated most sharply in Asia, where investors were also shaken after Rams Home Loans Group of Australia, a nonbank lender which earlier in the week warned that its earnings could be hurt by rising costs for its U.S. borrowings, confirmed Thursday that it had been unable to refinance $5 billion in debt.""It's a kind of a panic among individual investors,"" said Cho Hong Rae, head of research at Korea Investment & Securities in Seoul, adding that domestic retail investors had up until Thursday generally been buying shares as they declined.In Europe, shares of banking stocks were hard-hit as equity markets retreated. The worst-hit included BNP Paribas, which last week sparked a mraket rout when it revealed it had frozen three funds in subprime mortgages had been invested. Shares were down 2.9 percent at midday. ABN AMRO, the target of a takeover battle that would create the world's largest bank, fell 1.3 percent at midday.The continued declines on global markets have fanned concerns that the subprime crisis may begin to generate a consumer pullback in the United States, triggering an economic slowdown that may hit America's export partners.In an interview published in the Wall Street Journal Thursday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said the turmoil would exact a toll on U.S. growth, but the financial system and the economy were strong enough to withstand it without a recession.But ABN AMRO, in a note to clients Thursday, cautioned: ""Although today will likely again be dominated by concerns over credit markets, at some point the concerns will move to consumer confidence, consumption and the global economy.""The turmoil is also triggering concern among some politicians. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, in a letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel released Thursday, said he did not expect current market volatility to affect the real economy, Reuters reported. But he urged authorities to be ""very vigilant"" over financial market corrections, and said he would seek a discussion about markets with the Group of Seven countries, central banks and the International Monetary Fund in Washington in October.The letter was released a day after Merkel's cabinet approved new transparency rules for hedge funds and private equity, which would oblige them to disclose how they finance bids.Regulators in Brussels are also preparing to increase their surveillence of financial markets and potential triggers for further turmoil. On Thursday, Antonia Mochan, spokeswoman for the European Commission, said at a special press briefing on the subprime crisis that Brussels officials are preparing toscrutinize credit rating agencies more closely in the wake of recent market turmoil.The probe, said Mochan, would be led by Internal Markets Commissioner Charlie McCreevy and focus on the management of ratings agencies and any possible conflicts of interest.McCreevy's inquiry, first reported by the Financial Times, also would focus on ""concerns we have to their slowness with regard to market deterioration since mid-2006,"" said Mochan. She was apparently referring to how ratings agencies only accelerated their downgrades of mortgage-backed securities earlier this year.A concern raised by some analysts -- and now apparently shared by European officials like McCreevy -- is that ratings agencies like Standard & Poor's and Moody's may be hamstrung by conflicts of interest, because they may be earning income by providing services like consultancy to the very issuers they are supposed to be rating.But Mochan said McCreevy was unlikely to take any concrete actions until April 2008, when other bodies - the Committee of European Securities Regulators and International Organization of Securities Commissions - completed separate reviews looking at the activities and management of the ratings agencies.""Our review will be in parallel,"" said Mochan, adding that McCreevy would meet in September with the chairman of the Committee of European Securities Regulators to discuss the issue of ratings agencies.Mochan also spoke about the regulation of hedge funds, but she appeared to play down the need for any immediate measures. ""We have a general eye on market developments and regulatory supervision,"" she said, referring to hedge funds.In Asia, governments were also keeping a close eye on market volatility. President Roh Moo Hyun of South Korea urged investors not to overreact to the global financial market instability, as the South Korean benchmark Kospi stock index suffered its biggest decline in more than five years Thursday, falling 6.9 percent. Similar declines occurred in Indonesia and the Philippines.""South Korea's stock market is overly sensitive to the subprime mortgage financial crisis,"" Cheon Ho Seon, a spokesman for the president, said at a news conference. ""The fundamentals of the South Korean economy are solid and the impact from the subprime mortgage will be limited.""Panic and frustration among small investors in South Korea were clear.

Declines in the region's other big markets were lesssevere, but still dramatic: Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 stock average fellby about 2 percent; and Hong Kong's benchmark dropped 3.3 percent.Chinese stocks were lower too. During recent trading sessions, they havebrushed off drops in other parts of the world.In South Korea, panic and frustration among retail investors were clear.

That contributed to a sharp fall in U.S. stocks on Wednesdaythat was echoed in Asia on Thursday.The market in Australia was also hit Thursday by more repercussions fromthe U.S. credit crisis. Rams Home Loans Group, a nonbank lender whichearlier in the week warned that its earnings could be hurt by rising costsfor its U.S. borrowings, confirmed Thursday that it had been unable torefinance $5 billion in debt.The company's shares dropped 46 percent to 86.5 Australian cents, wellbelow its price at an initial share offering last month.Analysts in Australia said Rams' problems were unlikely to have much affecton the country's banks, because they do not rely significantly on borrowingfrom the United States.""In the end the impact on them will not be so severe,"" said Ben Zucker, ananalyst at Macquarie Bank in Sydney.Nonetheless, companies and financial institutions that had taken advantageof a booming American appetite for debt to borrow U.S. dollars cheaply andfund costs at home in Australia where the currency has been appreciatingare likely to suffer a sudden whiplash effect now as interest rates riseand the U.S. dollar regains ground, he said.The benchmark Australian S&P/ASX 200 index ended down 1.3 percent.The most recent sell off of Asian markets started with hedge fundsunwinding their positions, but now broadly focused retail investors arestarting to sell, said Henry To, co-founder of MarketThoughts, a hedge fundadvisor in Los Angeles.The subprime implosion in the United States is taking a direct toll onretail investors, spooking them further. Unlike in the United States,retail investors in some Asian markets, particularly Australia, can investin hedge funds, To noted. Basis Capital, one of Australia's largest hedgefunds, said it may have lost 80 percent of its capital because of Americansubprime problems. ""Most of those losses were taken by retail investors,""Mr. To said.""We don't know the full extent of the subprime problem in Asia yet,"" saidTo. ""At this point everyone is still guessing,"" he said.To be sure, it remains unclear exactly to what extent retail investors arepulling out of the market.In India, the benchmark BSE Sensex 30 index was down about 4 percent afterbeeing shut on Wednesday for a holiday.Markets in India have been whipsawed in recent months, and many marketmakers were loathe to call the drop a sign that retail investors weredeserting stocks.""Definitely foreign investors have sold off, but the way they put moneyinto the markets over the past two or three months, that sell off wasexpected,"" said Dinesh Thakkar, the managing director of Angel Broking,headquartered in Mumbai.""I don't see any panic happening in India,"" said Thakkar. Much ofThursday's drop was due to foreign investors who are booking profits, hesaid, and a lot of what they had to sell was absorbed by domestic investorswho had been sitting on the sidelines.There is some evidence that domestic investors helped to prevent steepersell-offs in India over the past week. From July 27 to August 14, foreigninvestors sold 773 billion rupees ($TK) from India's Bombay Stock Exchangeand National Stock Exchange, as domestic investors bought some 454 billionrupees in the same exchanges, according to data from the exchanges.But in South Korea, Cho said that most domestic selling was still byindividuals trying to unload individual stocks. So far, he said, localmutual funds were not seeing a market increase in redemptions that wouldforce them to join the selling.And automatic contributions to pension funds were still being made to biginstitutions, which were taking advantage of the latest declines to buystocks more cheaply, he said."
12,"FRANKFURT —Stocks on Wall Street plunged Thursday for a second straight day, extending a selloff that has gripped markets around the world as credit fears stemming from the American mortgage market crisis deepened. The seemingly unstoppable declines brought calls by European officials for more scrutiny of financial markets and the ratings agencies responsible for assessing the risk of subprime debt.""The psychology is shifting notably today,"" said David Bowers, a global strategist at Absolute Strategy Research in London. ""When a market drops by 10 percent, people start to feel it in their portfolios. People are used to stock markets behaving in a non-volatile and even bullish manner.""The Dow Jones Industrial Average traded down more than 300 points at one point, pulling the blue chip index into a 10 percent drop in stock prices from their highs. Asian markets, burned by Wall Street's sharp losses a day earlier, slumped Thursday as the Korean index slid nearly 7 percent, setting off a regional selloff. Across Europe, major markets fell between 2.5 percent and 4 percent.President Nicolas Sarkozy of France urged the Group of 7 industrial countries to step up their monitoring of international financial markets, and his finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said ministers could meet before their next meeting scheduled for October.The European Commission also said it would seek greater scrutiny of ratings agencies like Moody's and Standard & Poor's, companies that have built lucrative businesses by providing credible ratings to companies and investment products, a call that was also joined by Sarkozy. Now, the agencies stand accused of being slow to warn investors of problems in the subprime mortgage industry in the United States.""We have to ask ourselves the exact role rating agencies should play in mapping risks,"" Sarkozy said in letter to German Chancellor Angela Merkel a released Thursday, news services reported. ""Their role, which allies the creation of these products and the risk assessment, should be submitted to a careful examination.""Ratings agencies have said they are cooperating in an review led by securities regulators.Suspicions that hidden losses from investments in subprime-related securities might still pop up world still loom large, making investors reluctant to fuel what only recently seemed like a bullish market.On Thursday, a Spanish fund, March Monetario Dinamico, announced it had limited withdrawals for around 3,000 investors due to knock-on effects from the world-wide credit squeeze, Reuters reported. The limitation on withdrawals from the €250 million, or $340 million, fund is in response to the freezing of the BNP Paribas fund Parvest Dynamic ABS, although withdrawals were restricted to just the 5.6 percent weighting of the BNP Paribas fund, Banca March said.Citing subprime exposure, BNP Paribas, one of the largest French banks, froze €1.6 billion worth of funds last Thursday, triggering a sharp decline in financial markets.At the heart of the problem with subprime loans is the seized-up market for these securities, which are backed by mortgages that are now going sour.Very little trading of them is going on, making it difficult to fix a price. To remedy the situation, holders of these investments have to be willing or able to take losses, while buyers need to have the appetite for new risk - two developments that are likely to unfold slowly.""This process is likely to play out for the next three to six months,"" said Chris Mahoney, Vice Chairman-Moody's Investors Service.Against this backdrop, many investors found themselves pondering whether the subprime crisis, now mostly confined to one sector of the U.S. economy, would spread and help trigger slowdowns elsewhere in the world - two contingencies that seemed remote until very recently.""We are getting a lot of questions on these basic tenets of the economy,"" said Erik Nielsen, chief Europe economist at Goldman Sachs in London.U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson told The Wall Street Journal that market turmoil ""will extract a penalty"" on growth in the United States, but said the economy and financial markets are ""strong enough to absorb the losses."" That fact is helping to drive down stocks in emerging markets and Asia, two regions heavily reliant on exports to the world's largest economy.Lagarde of France offered a similar, if more narrow, assessment for France. ""We have every reason to feel confident about the situation of the French banking sector,"" Lagarde said, Reuters reported.The notion that sliding markets might be a more common feature of the financial landscape appeared to be sinking in as even smaller investors contemplated whether now was the time to cut their losses.But evidence of widespread small-investor exodus appeared spotty, for now at least.""The majority of our investors seem to be holding tight at the moment,"" said Juliette Schooling, head of research for Chelsea Financial Services in London, which manages roughly £1 billion in investments for retail investors ranging from small savers to high net worth individuals.While Chelsea's fund managers have received some calls from concerned investors, she said, there did not seem to be any sense of panic. Some of that calm could be due to the fact that many people are away on summer vacations and not keeping close tabs on the market's recent gyrations, Schooling conceded.Countrywide Financial, the largest U.S. mortgage lender, said Thursday it has tapped $11.5 billion in emergency loans from 40 of the world's largest banks, as it seeks to shore up its cash position, deepening the fresh slide on Wall Street.The company, which relies heavily on raising money from Wall Street, acted a day after a prominent analyst suggested it may have to file for bankruptcy if banks and investors shut off the spigot of money to Countrywide.Wayne Arnold reported from Singapore, Sang- Hun Choe from Seoul, Heather Timmons from Delhi and James Kanter and Nicola Clark from Paris."

14,"OTTAWA, Aug. 16  Banks and money managers came together Thursday to end a credit crisis in an arcane branch of Canada’s debt market.The group signed an agreement that is expected to resolve a situation where some nonbank holders of asset-backed commercial paper were unable to roll over their debt and get their banks to provide emergency financing.Unlike the subprime mortgages causing turmoil in markets in the United States, the debt in the Canadian liquidity problem was viewed as generally of high quality. It is made up largely of credit card loans, auto loans and leases and market-rate mortgages that have been repackaged into short-term securities.“This does not appear to be an issue of the underlying assets,” said David Wolf, the head of Canadian economics and chief strategist of Merrill Lynch Canada. “The flare-up looks to be an outgrowth of increased risk aversion globally.”The specific problem resulted from another Canadian exception. Unlike their United States counterparts, Canadian banks are not required by regulators to give holders of commercial paper  companies that have made the loans  cash for liquidity on demand. Instead, they must extend cash only in the event of a “market disruption,” a determination that the government leaves up to the bankers.The Toronto-based Coventree, which has about 16 billion Canadian dollars ($14.8 billion) in asset-backed commercial paper, was the first of several companies that said the bankers would not provide it with cash after concluding that there was no market disruption.About 40 billion Canadian dollars in asset-backed commercial paper is held outside banks, in addition to about 75 billion Canadian dollars held by the country’s five large chartered banks.On Wednesday, the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec summoned several other pension plans, ABN Amro, Barclays Capital, UBS, the National Bank of Canada, the Desjardins Group, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and Merrill Lynch to its Montreal headquarters.After a session that ran late Wednesday and resumed Thursday morning, the group agreed to convert asset-backed commercial paper, which normally matures in 30 to 60 days, into long-term notes with a floating interest rate. Until that happens, they have agreed not to make margin calls on holders of the paper for 150 days and to drop all current liquidity calls.“This agreement that was published isn’t necessarily a great solution for everyone,” Mr. Wolf said. “But what would happen if they said no?”Coventree, the Bank of Canada and the country’s finance minister, Jim Flaherty, were among those who supported the plan.Not everyone was convinced that the problem was solved. Despite the agreement, Coventree’s shares fell 5.3 percent, to 3.70 Canadian dollars, below its 52-week high of 16.30 Canadian dollars.Nor will all investors be interested in the debt after its maturity extension begins.Among them is Ken Anderson, who manages the United States and Canada money market funds for Fidelity Investments.“They’re going to take these extendible securities and turn them out into a three- and five-year portion of the curve,"" Mr. Anderson said during a conference call with investment advisers. “We cannot invest out past one year. So I’m not sure what type of solution this is. I think the holders of these securities will be forced to sell and most likely take some losses in their funds."""
15,"Shut out of the short-term debt market by an expanding credit crisis, Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest mortgage lender, turned yesterday to 40 of the biggest banks, borrowing $11.5 billion as it tried to shore up its cash.The move sent ripples through the stock market — the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell as much as 2.6 percent before recovering and ending the day slightly up — and it raised the chance that even the bluest of blue-chip mortgage companies could fail if investors and lenders lost confidence in them.Countrywide said it would make significant changes in its operations by largely limiting itself to only the safest mortgages that can be bought by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-chartered agencies.That means some home buyers will pay more and have fewer choices when they borrow more than $417,000, the limit on loans the agencies can buy. Others will be required to put down at least 10 percent of the purchase price, and those with blemished or incomplete credit histories may no longer qualify for loans.“For better or for worse, Countrywide is the public face of U.S. mortgage lending,” said Guy Cecala, publisher of Inside Mortgage Finance, which covers home lending. “It has been the largest, and it has grown with the market.”In the first six months, the company made $245 billion in home loans, 17.4 percent of the total nationwide.Shares of Countrywide fell 11 percent, or $2.34, to close at $18.95. They had fallen as low as $15. The stock is down about 55 percent for the year. The price of the company’s bonds also fell and the cost of insuring its debt jumped sharply.Traditionally, banks made mortgages by lending the money that they took in as deposits, and they held the loans until they were repaid. Countrywide and most rivals largely do not operate that way. They borrow money from banks and investors on Wall Street, and when they close a mortgage they quickly sell, repeating the cycle over and over. Until recently, the relationship has been extremely profitable for both sides.But as defaults on mortgages made in recent years have surged, the system has started to break down.On Wednesday, Countrywide sought to raise money by issuing short-term debt known as commercial paper, something it does regularly. But there was no demand on Wall Street, according to two people briefed on the situation. Less than two weeks ago, the company said it had access to $50 billion in commercial paper, which has a term of nine months or less. In the last few days, the market for short-term debt has seized up, particularly for loans that are tied to mortgages, because investors say they can no longer value them.John Kodweis, managing director in JPMorgan’s short-term fixed income group, called it “the most challenging day since 1998,” but said his firm was able to place almost $30 billion with investors. That is JPMorgan’s typical volume, but the debt was placed at higher prices, and it took longer to find buyers.On Wednesday, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, Kenneth Bruce, put a “Sell” rating on Countrywide stock, saying liquidity problems could force the company to seek bankruptcy protection in severe circumstances. Dozens of lenders have already met a similar fate. Yesterday, First Magnus Financial, a small lender, stopped making loans because it could not sell mortgages to investors.“This is a credit crunch and crisis created independently of individual companies,” said Eric Flamholtz, a management professor at the University of California, Los Angeles who previously served as a consultant to Countrywide executives. “All these companies are getting crushed, some for no reason.”Analysts say Countrywide is likely to have a better chance of surviving than many of its rivals. For one thing, it had a contingency plan that included the committed bank loans it used yesterday. The company also has a bank subsidiary, Countrywide Bank, which it plans to use to make the majority of its loans by the end of September.If it does make it, the company will look significantly different.In a statement, Countrywide, which is based in Calabasas, Calif., said that 90 percent of the home loans it will make will conform to standards set by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Less than two months ago, the company had said about 50 percent of its loans were eligible to be bought by the agencies.A spokesman for Countrywide, Rick Simon, said the company was still making loans, including so-called jumbo mortgages that are larger than $417,000. He declined to comment further.The changes are expected to significantly alter how the company and the industry do business. Countrywide, which was hiring aggressively in recent months as rivals were shutting down, will probably scale back its operations. At the end of June, the company had 33,800 employees in its loan production business, up from 32,500 12 months before.As Countrywide retrenches, traditional banks like Bank of America, Citibank and JPMorgan that can make and hold jumbo loans are expected to gain market share. Another winner will be regional banks and credit unions, which lost significant market share during the real estate boom.“Thousands and thousands of homes are coming back to us,” said Alfred A. DelliBovi, the president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, which finances community banks.In fact, Countrywide itself is turning to the Federal Home Loan Bank system, which was created in the 1930s by the federal government to stimulate lending during the Depression. Countrywide Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta. At the end of June, Countrywide had the capacity to borrow $40.7 billion from the Home Loan Bank, of which $11.9 billion was still available.In a securities filing, Countrywide said its new debt would restrict its ability to engage in merger or acquisition talks and require the company to maintain a net worth of at least $7.7 billion. About $4.3 billion of the loans have a term of five years and the rest have a one-year term.Moody’s Investor Service, Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings, the bond ratings firms, cut their ratings on Countrywide yesterday and said further cuts were possible. The company’s ratings are still considered investment grade. Moody’s and Fitch also cut the ratings of Residential Capital, the home lending arm of GMAC, to junk status.Moody’s also downgraded 691 mortgage securities totaling $19.4 billion that are backed by second loans used when borrowers with weak, or subprime, credit do not have enough for a down payment. The deals represent 76 percent of all such securities issued last year, including many that had Moody’s top Aaa rating."
16,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 16 — What happened to the Hammer?After decades at Goldman Sachs, where his nickname came from his aggressive deal-making, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. was hailed last year when he took office as especially equipped to manage potential market crises.But the financial disorder this August has brought few public appearances and only general reassurances on economic fundamentals from Mr. Paulson, who has left it to the Federal Reserve to act. There has been no talk of bailouts, policy changes, new federal regulations or other Treasury actions to stem the contagion in global markets.“I don’t believe that more regulation of private pools of capital, or more regulations or laws in general, would insulate investors from losses or would be effective,” Mr. Paulson said in an interview with The New York Times on Thursday. “I don’t think it’s constructive right now in the middle of this market turmoil to start pointing fingers and making specific policy recommendations.”While the Fed usually takes the lead in times of crisis, Treasury secretaries have also played important roles by reassuring the public that they have a grip on the markets’ problems and stand ready to address the financial system’s vulnerabilities. But Treasury officials have also always been cautious about predicting which way markets will go, knowing that their comments can backfire embarrassingly.The administration’s upbeat comments last week, for example, almost seemed to be mocked by subsequent market declines. And after President Bush said there was “enough liquidity” in the system last week, the Federal Reserve the next day provided large infusions of cash.Still, many on Wall Street and in Washington expected that Mr. Paulson would have been more visible in talking about the economy over the last two weeks, especially considering his reputation for seizing the agenda.“It’s reasonable that some time would elapse before the administration proposes anything,"" said Alan S. Blinder, a former Fed vice chairman, who is a professor of economics at Princeton. ""But I think they should be thinking about what, if anything, ought to be done after the dust has settled. They may not be doing that.""Mr. Paulson did say that the administration and Congress might want to look at the housing sector, especially the causes of the collapse in the subprime mortgage market, which has tightened lending across the board and rocked stock markets around the globe. He ruled out any immediate fixes, however.And while Mr. Paulson declined to be specific, Treasury officials indicated that the department may be rethinking its opposition to a request by the two giant federal mortgage agencies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to raise the caps on their mortgage portfolios in an effort to ease the credit squeeze.Mr. Paulson first spoke about the market turmoil early last week and then went silent until an interview with The Wall Street Journal, which appeared on Thursday, saying the current market chaos might lower the national growth rate but would not cause a widespread downturn.“You’re not going to get a forecast from me as to how long this period will last,” Mr. Paulson said in the Times interview, referring to the current instability. “It could take a while to work through this situation. It could be that there will be more unpleasant news on the way, some organizations that don’t exist and some losses.”“But our economy is resilient,” he added. “The markets are resilient. They can absorb those losses. We’ve gone through challenging times in the markets, and we will rise to the challenge.”The market instability is nonetheless certain to prompt debate in Washington over whether the Bush administration has been right to resist more regulation of American capital markets, on the ground that regulations have made them less competitive with those in Europe.Mr. Paulson acknowledged that he was wary of making as many public comments about the markets as some may want.“My view from the day I came down here was not to talk unless I had something to say,” Mr. Paulson said. “It’s not my role to do play-by-play commentary on the markets.”The Treasury secretary said that, at meetings in Asia last year, he and his counterparts in the world’s finance ministries and central banks discussed the possibility of an economic crisis like the one in 1998 after Russia defaulted.“We weren’t predicting financial turmoil, but we were saying that we’ve gone a long time without a 1998-type event,” he said. “These movements are inevitable and we agreed we should get ready. We talked about how the next time there was financial turmoil, it was going to be more global.”Mr. Paulson said the crisis, which began in a weak sector, spread to stronger sectors because of the “unstructured nature of capital markets,” the “dramatic increase” in private pools of capital beyond the reach of regulators, and the complexity of the derivatives and other products they invest in or trade.The Treasury secretary said that there needed to be more transparency in the system — that is, more disclosure of the holdings and actions of hedge funds and other private pools of capital. “How can you be against more transparency?” he asked, adding that the best way of achieving it was through the funds drawing up their own best practices on disclosure and other safeguards.Arthur Levitt Jr., the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said in an interview that it was too early to say whether the voluntary approach would be adequate or whether federal regulators would need to play more of a role.“After the past two weeks, I think you will hear calls for greater transparency throughout government, from the Treasury, from the S.E.C. and maybe even from the White House,” said Mr. Levitt, who is heading an advisory panel on auditing reforms for the Treasury. “But the last thing the country needs is false reassurance from political figures. Even less do they need calls for regulation that represent overkill.”Mr. Paulson said that, in principle, he also believed that regulators should try to eliminate fraud and market manipulation. He also said that it was inadvisable for them to try to eliminate risk in the economy, or for the government to bail out institutions that took unwise risks, unless the system itself were in peril.“The genius of our system is that it recognizes that if you’re going to give entrepreneurs and investors the chance to succeed and reap the benefits of their risk-taking, they also need the freedom to fail,” he said.But many experts say that Mr. Paulson has to look at broader systemic failures in the current environment, even if he does not want to talk about them. For example, if the Fed lowers interest rates, and the European Central Bank raises interest rates as it is hinting it might do, would there be a run on the dollar?“I view a lower dollar as both desirable and inevitable,” said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who argues that an overvalued dollar is making imports artificially cheap."
17,"Twenty-first-century financial markets react with lightning speed to events halfway around the world. Investors in China can immediately see what happened in New York and make trades in London based on the news.So why is the credit panic of 2007 being played out in slow motion?One reason is that those involved have never seen anything like this before. Information may arrive instantly, but insight takes longer.It seemed unlikely, if not absurd, that the American economy and credit system could be shaken because a few people with poor credit fell behind on their mortgages. Why should that slow consumer spending? Why should it affect companies that made mortgage loans only to people with good credit? Why should it bring a halt to the leveraged buyout boom?Perhaps none of those things should happen. But fears that they may take place have sent the stock market on a wild ride over the last month, culminating yesterday with the Dow Jones industrial average falling more than 300 points before gaining nearly all of them back in the final hour of trading, amid speculation that the Federal Reserve would find a way to keep troubled financial companies from failing. Not long ago — four weeks, to be exact — Larry A. Goldstone, the president of Thornburg Mortgage, a real estate investment trust, was feeling good. He had seen the subprime mortgage disaster unfold, and believed it was good for his company.“The current credit crisis is the market environment today,” he said in a conference call on July 20, as the stock rose above $27. “The liquidity issues in the marketplace are creating a very, very nice opportunity for us. This is not a big surprise to us.”The way he saw it, the crisis was shaking out his competitors, the ones who had made those imprudent loans. With them gone, he could make more money.Within days, he bought 10,000 shares. The chairman and chief executive, Garrett Thornburg, invested almost $13 million in company stock. Four other insiders, including the chief financial officer, were also buyers.But last week, things got dicey. Thornburg Mortgage owned a lot of AAA-rated mortgage securities, and had borrowed up to 95 percent of their value. Now the lenders, suspecting the securities were worth less, wanted more cash. To get it, Thornburg had to sell securities, and few wanted to buy. Suddenly the commercial paper market, so willing to lend to Thornburg at small margins just weeks before, was not interested in lending even at much higher rates.As for the share price, it went into a free fall on Tuesday, amid rumors that the company could not meet its obligation. Trading was halted with the stock under $8. On Tuesday night, it conceded it was having trouble raising money to finance mortgages. It said the dividend it had promised to pay on Wednesday would be delayed by a month.But it insisted that it was not bankrupt. Even marking down the value of its assets to current market value, it said, it was worth $14.28 a share on Monday, down from $19.38 at the end of June.That provided some reassurance, and since then the shares have climbed back above $12.Thornburg has prospered until now with a fairly simple formula. Organized as a REIT, it paid big dividends representing all of its taxable income. It grew by issuing more shares, which it could sell at prices above its book value because individual investors valued the high yield. The shares wound up in a lot of retirement accounts, and the fact that people paid more than book value enabled the book value per share to grow.The insiders profited hugely from that. The company gets away with not disclosing how much the bosses are paid because it is managed by a separate company owned by some of the bosses. That management company gets incentive fees based on the company’s total book value and profits, a formula that would seem familiar to a hedge fund manager. Effectively, the bosses get a cut every time the company sells new stock, and keep getting cuts from those sales every year.Now Thornburg, like many other companies, needs a quick unfreezing of the credit markets. But even if they get it — if the Fed tells banks to rescue them with emergency loans — many may find that they cannot safely operate with such high leverage. And without the leverage, profits will be harder to make even if Thornburg can charge more for mortgage loans.The unfortunate series of events that got us here — remember the proverb in which a kingdom is lost for want of a nail — began with a weakening housing market. That caused some mortgages to go into default, which raised questions about the value of mortgage securities and the credibility of the ratings that enabled the securities to be sold.That led to the questioning of other types of loans that had been financed by selling packages of securities that were structures in similar ways to ones that had financed the mortgages. It became more difficult for companies to borrow. Now it seems to be spilling over to the real economy, with consumers getting nervous.“We are going through a psychological event,” Mr. Goldstone said. “It has everybody in a panic. There is nothing fundamental here.”He may be wrong about that last part. There may not have been a fundamental change in the health of his business, but such a change is taking place in the credit markets. There, buyers with available cash are few, and many of them are in no hurry to buy when so many need to sell.It is sort of like a game of musical chairs in which the music stops and it turns out that all the chairs have vanished."
18,"HONG KONG, Aug. 16 — In the past, when economic growth has stalled in the rest of the world, the United States has usually been there to pick up the slack. Now that dynamic is reversed.With stock markets plunging around the world on financial worries clearly marked “made in U.S.A.,” and with growing concerns about a possible American economic slowdown, a booming global economy could help contain the damage and even assist the United States in absorbing the shock of the collapsing housing bubble and a credit squeeze.“We’re no longer in a world where the United States sneezes and the rest of the world catches a cold,” said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist with Global Insight, an economics research firm in Waltham, Mass. “You’ve got strong growth overseas, and it’s been kind of like a lifeline to the United States from the rest of the world.”But in Asia, where growth has been strongest in recent years, many countries are still worried that American troubles could drag them down as well. Experts say those nations are less interested in extending a lifeline to the United States than in discovering whether they have reduced their ties to the American consumer.Countries in Asia, particularly China, have started chafing at their dependence on the thirst of Americans for imported goods, on the sway of the American dollar around the world and on American financial institutions.It is true, Asian business executives and economists say, that fundamental economic changes have limited Asia’s need for American consumers and financial markets. But it is still not clear, they say, how much effect the current financial turmoil is likely to have outside the United States.“Definitely the reliance on the U.S. economy, particularly from the Asian economies, has lessened a bit over the last five to seven years,” said Sanjay Mehta, the chief executive of Essar Shipping of India. “There will be an impact — I don’t see that there will be no impact — but less of an impact than we saw in 2001 and 2002, when the Internet bubble crashed.”Though the European Union as a whole is close to the scale of the American economy, the United States still has the largest, most powerful economy in the world. With a gross domestic product of more than $13 trillion, it is three times the size of the second-largest economy, Japan, which remains just ahead of China. But the improvements overseas have given the United States a lesser role in shaping the ups and downs of global economic activity.“There has been a decoupling of the U.S. economy from the world economy,” said Simon Johnson, chief economist of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. “It’s almost as if everyone in the world is on the uptake and the United States is on the downtake.”Indeed, many in Asia have been taking pride in the extent to which the region seems to have been weaning itself from reliance on the United States economy.At the Canton Fair in April, executives from across China were enthusiastic about sales prospects in Europe, as China’s exports to Europe had surpassed exports to the United States in February.In Baharbari, a small village of thatched huts at the end of a muddy track in northeastern India, most of the young men have left for jobs on housing construction sites in northwestern India, part of a broader boom in domestic demand across much of Asia.And in Bangkok, cement executives like Prachai Leophairatana exude confidence when talking about exports to Vietnam, part of a surge in commerce among East Asian nations that has made the region the world’s fastest-growing center of trade.When the United States last went through a slowdown, six years ago, Asian exports went from 25 percent growth in 2000 to a 15 percent drop in 2002. But part of that plunge reflected the weakness of European and Japanese economies then, and these appear much stronger now.As businesses like Mizuho Financial Group in Japan and RAMS Home Loan Group in Australia encounter problems with subprime mortgages written in the United States, suspicion is also emerging about a trans-Pacific financial link that may have been deeper than anyone realized: the United States may have been paying for a lot of its imports in recent years with mortgage securities of dubious value.“It’s possible that the U.S. financial institutions are smart enough to have passed on the risk to Europe and elsewhere,” said Kui Wai Li, the director of the Asian business research center at the City University of Hong Kong.During the Asian financial crisis in 1997 and 1998, the “tiger” economies of Southeast Asia proved to be paper tigers, hobbled by poor corporate governance and uncontrolled borrowing. Now, from the Asian perspective, the United States is seen as the place where regulation has been weak and where consumers and businesses alike borrowed with little restraint.“The Asians do not trust the American economy any longer,” said Frank-Jürgen Richter, a specialist in Asian economies who is the president of Horasis, a research group in Geneva. “America is not the engine of globalization any more. They are looking for a new engine, and it might be China, it might be Europe — but it’s not the U.S.”Although Asian economies may not need the United States as much as they once did, financial and commercial ties remain strong and could prove to be a drag on the region. Moreover, said Lewis S. Alexander, chief economist at Citigroup, “if the United States economy were to go into a recession, you’d see a bigger impact abroad. The fact the world has done relatively well when the U.S. has had a slowdown does not mean if the U.S. had a recession, the rest of the world could go on relatively unaffected.”Indeed, as a percentage of its total economic output, China is still more than 25 times as dependent on exports to the United States as the United States is on exports to China.The bulk of Chinese exports to the United States are products for which the components are largely imported from elsewhere in Asia and snapped together by rows of Chinese workers under fluorescent lights. A serious slowdown in such businesses, for which China supplies little more than cheap labor, could still result in large-scale layoffs.Yet the consequences could be limited in a country where investment in roads, bridges, housing complexes and other fixed assets rose more than 25 percent in the first seven months of this year, compared with the period a year earlier.Meanwhile, while the dollar has strengthened against the euro and the British pound as traders have sought a safe haven from global financial troubles, it has tumbled this week against the yen and could fall more broadly if the housing debacle proves to have delivered a body blow to the entire American economy.For American industry, the broader decline in the dollar, coupled with stronger growth abroad, has served to energize exports by making American goods more competitive overseas.For example, Power Curbers of Salisbury, N.C., which makes equipment to lay roads, curbs and sidewalks, is counting on foreign business to keep it growing this year. International orders, which now come from more than 80 countries, are up about 25 percent, helping the company expand despite a 10 percent drop in domestic business this year.“They’re just growing like crazy,” said Dyke Messinger, the company’s chief executive. “Let’s say there’s more trouble to come in housing. Then international business will be critical.”But a weaker dollar would be a problem not just for Asian exporters, which would find it harder to compete in the American market, but also for Asian central banks, which have been the biggest buyers of dollars in recent years. China’s central bank, the People’s Bank of China, keeps about two-thirds of its $1.3 trillion foreign exchange reserves in dollars.That includes what experts describe as a $100 billion holding of American securities backed by mortgages, although that may have declined in value recently.If the dollar drops a lot further, Asia could be in trouble. So the man most watched in Asia now by business elites and government policy makers is Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is under pressure to cut interest rates to reassure Wall Street and stabilize shaky markets.“If you do reduce the interest rate, the dollar will fall,” said Mr. Mehta of the Indian shipping concern. “That is a major worry for most of the people in Asia right now.”"
19,"NEW YORK —The Federal Reserve, saying it feels that the recent disorder in financial markets has raised the risk of an economic downturn, surprised investors Friday by approving a half-percentage point cut in its discount rate on loans to banks. The move sent markets surging on Wall Street and in Europe.Although the cut does not affect the Fed interest rates that hold the most sway over the U.S. economy, it is nonetheless a significant change of tone for the central bank, which just last week left its benchmark short-term interest rates unchanged. It signals that policy makers may be prepared to cut interest rates more quickly than previously thought if the outlook worsens.The Fed appears to be acting now because it believes the fallout from problems in the credit market could further pressure a slowing U.S. economy. In recent days the cost of borrowing has jumped significantly. The market for commercial paper, a form of short-term debt used frequently by banks and businesses, has seized up. Interest rates for jumbo residential mortgages, or amounts greater than $417,000, have risen as several lenders shut down.""This is watershed statement from the Fed to let the markets and politicians know the Fed is 'prepared to act as needed,' "" Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, wrote in a note to clients. ""I think this is a signal that the funds rate will be cut by 25 or 50 basis points by the end of this year,"" or one-quarter to one-half a percentage point, he said.The Fed announcement came a little more than an hour before the markets opened on Wall Street. Within minutes of the opening bell, the Dow Jones industrial average soared 300 points. The market gave up some of those gains in late-morning trading, but in afternoon trading, the Dow was still up 150 points, or 1.2 percent, and other major U.S. stock indexes showed larger gains.The cut in the discount rate, at which the Fed lends money to banks it considers credit worthy, set it at 5.75 percent, down from 6.25 percent. That rate is still higher than the overnight lending rate between banks of 5.25 percent.At a meeting last week, the Fed's policy-making committee voted to leave the overnight rate unchanged, citing concerns that inflation had not settled down enough. Bit it also acknowledged that the risk of a downturn had increased ""somewhat.""The committee's remarks Friday made no mention of inflation. ""Financial market conditions have deteriorated, and tighter credit conditions and increased uncertainty have the potential to restrain economic growth going forward,"" one statement on the financial and economic outlook said. In that light, the Fed's policy-making committee judged that ""the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.""The Fed still expects that the economy will continue to expand at a ""moderate pace,"" though it said it is ""prepared to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects on the economy arising from the disruptions in financial markets.""The cut in the rate applied to banks that seek funds at the Fed's so-called discount window appears meant to assure banks that may be having trouble raising money that the Fed will do everything in its power to ensure cash is available at low rates.Unlike a change in the federal funds rate, a change in the discount rate does not have a direct impact on consumers. The federal funds rate influences everything from car loans to mortgages because it affects how much banks charge each other when they borrow money. The discount rate, however, applies only to banks that are having short-term financial difficulties.The upheaval gave Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, the first crisis of his 18-month tenure. In recent weeks, the Fed has intervened to support the markets by lending in the money markets against mortgage securities and Treasury notes. It did so again this morning, by lending $6 billion against mortgage securities. Since Aug. 9, the Fed has injected $94 billion into the system by lending in the open market.Market experts said the Fed's decision allows it, for now, to avoid taking the highly unusual step of lowering the federal funds rate between scheduled meetings so it can determine just how serious the damage to the economy is.But some economists said the Fed's decision to pump new money into the system also raised the question of whether it is bailing out investors who made bad decisions about subprime-related securities - the so-called ""moral hazard"" of central banking.For years, traders referred to the ""Greenspan put"" as their trump card in tough times, a reference to the willingness by the former Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, to severely lower interest rates after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks and the financial panic in 1998. In financial market jargon, a ""put option"" helps guard investors against losses.""We can take this one of two ways, either a major bank is in big trouble or else this is the 'Bernanke put option' in its full glory,"" said Jim Wood Smith at Williams de Broë in London.The New York TimesCarter Dougherty contributed reporting from Frankfurt."

21,"“We have to atone to our clients, but we have no right to whine for ourselves,” said Clifford Asness, the co-founder of AQR Capital Management, a money management firm that has been much in the news recently. “When we succeed, we make a boatload of money, we get imitators, and our risk increases. That’s how capitalism works.”We were speaking on Thursday, a week after one of the lousiest market days of his life. Along with James Simons of Renaissance Technologies and David Shaw of D. E. Shaw, Mr. Asness is one of the leading practitioners of what is called quantitative investing, using computer models to buy and sell thousands of stocks (and bonds and derivatives and commodities and currencies and country indexes and just about anything else that can be traded). Mr. Simons, Mr. Shaw and Mr. Asness, in particular, use these quant models to run what are called in the business “market neutral” hedge funds, meaning that their gains (or losses) are not dependent on whether the market goes up or down.AQR has about $37 billion under management, with $27 billion of that in plain vanilla equity funds. The rest is invested in its quant hedge funds, its best-known operations. Indeed, over the last seven years, AQR’s flagship hedge fund has been up, on average, 13.7 percent a year, after fees, handily outperforming the Standard &Poor’s 500, which gained only 1.9 percent annualized during that time.Mr. Asness himself is known for being ridiculously smart, highly engaging, and funny, with more one-liners than Henny Youngman. I got to know him, and to like him, a few years ago, when I wrote about him for The New York Times Magazine. He can get a little full of himself, but most of the time he can be brought back to earth with a small, friendly jab. In other words, he’s the rare hedge fund manager you’d like to have a beer with.Anyway, back to that awful Thursday. As you may recall, the market ended Aug. 9 down more than 380 points. That kind of day isn’t fun for anybody, but it was an especially brutal day for firms that are supposed to be indifferent to market ups and downs — namely, quant funds like those run by Mr. Asness and his partners. What made it especially painful is that their troubles on Thursday really had nothing to do with the market’s fall.In the days leading up to Thursday, Mr. Asness’s fund — and most other quant funds — had gotten clobbered. When the AQR flagship fund opened for business on Friday, Aug. 10, it was down 13 percent for August. Mr. Simons’s famed Medallion fund, which has rarely had a down month during nearly two decades of incredible performance, lost 8.7 percent in early August. By mid-August, Goldman Sachs’s flagship Global Alpha fund was down 26 percent for the year. Everywhere you looked in the little town of Quantsville, it was ugly.And then, in the blink of an eye, it turned around, at least for the moment. As of today, Mr. Asness’s fund had gained back half of what it lost in the previous two weeks, and was at break-even for the year. I hear through the grapevine that Mr. Simons has already made back every penny Medallion lost in early August. During its conference call earlier in the week, Goldman announced that it had rounded up $3 billion for one of its battered hedge funds; I’ll bet a steak dinner that that fund has seen some gains this week as well.All of which poses some big questions: What really happened during the Great Quant Meltdown of early August? More to the point, should it scare us or reassure us?•Let’s be honest here. You hear the words “quant fund meltdown,” and one firm comes to mind: Long-Term Capital Management.Back in 1998, that now infamous quant fund really did melt down, not only liquidating, but shaking the entire global financial system. Long-Term used complex computer models that failed to anticipate some severe once-in-a-lifetime market events, and it was shockingly leveraged — it was using $100 of borrowed money for every dollar of its own capital — which magnified its losses. It was also run by some of the smartest people on Wall Street. “When Genius Failed” was the apt title to Roger Lowenstein’s fine book about that fiasco.Ever since, whenever quant funds stumble, it’s “When Genius Failed Redux.” Wall Street wags begin to wonder if those losses will lead to something truly cataclysmic, while newspaper reporters take a certain undisguised glee in reporting on really smart people losing money. Even now, there’s enough Luddite schadenfreude in the air that rumors continue to circulate that AQR is continuing to absorb substantial losses — which is the exact opposite of the truth, Mr. Asness says.What is scary in this case is not that the quant funds were the initial source of a ripple effect on the rest of the market; they weren’t. The quant funds were the recipients of a ripple that began in a corner of the market that they had little to do with —namely, the subprime mortgage crisis. It’s the way the subprime contagion shook the quants, whose subsequent downturn then added to the ripple effect,that’swhat is nervous-making.Mr. Asness’s hedge fund offers a case in point. Does his fund deal with the subprime business? Not in any significant way. Rather, the securities that cost AQR so much money were good old-fashioned equities.To oversimplify (sorry: you can’t explain this stuff without oversimplifying), AQR’s market neutral funds use computers to sort through a set of complex but common-sensical criteria to identify all sorts of assets — including stocks — that it believes are undervalued but gaining some momentum, which means that both price and fundamentals are improving. It buys, literally, thousands of those stocks. Then it seeks out stocks it believes are overvalued and starting to lose momentum. It shorts those stocks. What makes the fund “market neutral” is that it always tries to have the same amount long as short. Mr. Asness likes to say that it’s not really rocket science but intuitive investing; the computers mainly allow him to do it across thousands of stocks at the same time.Mr. Asness does not suggest that he is going to be on the winning side of every trade. Not even close. Nor does Mr. Asness suggest that his strategy is risk-free. It’s not. “If you don’t take any risk, you won’t make any money,” he said. Even when things are going swimmingly, he’s going to have almost as many losing trades as winning ones. But over time the winning trades will add to better-than-average gains. In a down market, he hopes that his shorts will fall more than his longs, and in an up market, he wants the longs to rise more than the shorts.As for risk, he adds leverage to bolster returns; indeed using borrowed money to calibrate risk is a major part of his strategy. But it’s not crazy stuff like Long-Term Capital Management, and it would be hard to argue with his results over time.What happened in August is something that happens to every investor at times, even Warren E. Buffett: his strategy stopped working. So did Mr. Simons’s strategy and that of all the other quants. Mr. Asness’s trades weren’t just a little off — they were hugely off. The undervalued stocks he was buying were dropping steeply, but he wasn’t getting any help from the short side of his portfolio. Several “quants” I spoke to — market veterans who had been through the 1987 market crash and the 1998 Long-Term Capital disaster — told me they had never seen anything quite like it.Why did it happen? In the immortal words of the market sage, James Grant, “On Wall Street, every good idea is driven into the ground like a tomato stake.” Quant investing, as practiced by the likes of Mr. Asness, Mr. Simons and others, has been enormously successful. And anything that’s successful on Wall Street is invariably going to be copied by others. That is exactly what’s happened in many cases at firms that did other things besides quant investing — like trading in derivatives built around subprime loans.As these subprime instruments have cratered, investors have lost faith not just in them but in other credit derivatives. The holders of these securities had to meet margin calls and make other payments. So they had to start selling more liquid securities like, well, the kind of easily traded securities held in their quant equity portfolios, like Microsoft or I.B.M. or General Electric. And as they sold, other quant shops, like AQR, which held many of the same stocks, saw huge drops instead of small gains. Is it any wonder traders are calling this a contagion?One line making the rounds on Wall Street is that the events of last week show that, just as with Long-Term Capital Management, the quants’ models didn’t work — that bloodless computers simply can’t anticipate events outside the norm. That line drives Mr. Asness bonkers. “In theory, what just happened is impossible, so if we stuck to the theory, we’d be dead,” he said. “We know this stuff happens.” Once they realized the magnitude, he and his partners quickly began a mild “deleveraging” to protect against even bigger losses. Eventually, AQR started buying cheap stock again — which had become even cheaper thanks to the short-term panic.In the view of several big-time quants I spoke to, their big mistake was in not realizing that their little corner of Wall Street had become so crowded with imitators — and that when others were forced to sell, they were going to get hurt. Now they are all trying to figure out how to factor that into their thinking for the future — Mr. Asness very much included. “We have a new risk factor in our world,” he said.So how should the rest of us feel about what just happened? Even though the worst seems to be over, I still think we should still be worried. But not because computer-driven quant funds took a tumble. That’s a symptom, not a cause. The larger issue is the contagion itself — the fact that something so out of left field, like subprime, could wind up hurting the quants.Richard Bookstaber, a former quant manager, has recently written a book, called “A Demon of Our Own Design” (Wiley, 2007), which has become a small sensation on Wall Street. In it, he argues that the proliferation of complex financial products like derivatives, combined with use of leverage to bolster returns, will inevitably mean that there will be a regular stream of market contagions like the one we’re having now — one of which, someday, could be calamitous. To him, last week’s quant crisis is a classic case in point. “I think crises become inevitable when you have a financial structure like ours,” he said. “How deep or how frequent they are, I wouldn’t want to predict.” Well, who would?So yes, it really is a scary world out there. But quants like Mr. Asness aren’t the reason."
22,"The Federal Reserve Board’s move yesterday to stabilize the credit markets helped to ease the pressure on a mundane but crucial part of the financial markets: short-term lending to corporations.Borrowing of money short-term  called issuing commercial paper  seized up this week as investors became nervous at the prospect that many of those notes were backed by mortgages that no longer have ready buyers.“The commercial paper market is the eye of the storm,” said Ed Devlin, a portfolio manager at Pimco, the big fixed-income investment firm. “The reason the Fed is concerned is that there is a real collateral squeeze and issues around funding.”Until recently, the $2.2 trillion commercial paper market was considered one of the safest places on Wall Street. But over the last few days, many investors have been navigating it like the airport highway in Baghdad.Yesterday, some of the concerns began to ease. Commercial paper traders called the last week the worst in their career since the 1998 financial crisis that brought down the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management.The market is a little-noticed but vital part of the world’s financial infrastructure. And all week, it seemed that one financial bomb after another was exploding.The rating agency, Standard & Poor’s, warned that it might downgrade a handful of lenders and hedge fund issuers, and Moody’s sharply cut the ratings of nearly 700 subprime mortgage bonds. Countrywide Financial, the mortgage lender, could not sell its notes, leading it to obtain emergency bank financing.In Canada, two groups of big banks preliminarily agreed to provide $120 billion, in United States dollars, in financing to companies there, amid a global pullback. Even the notes of seemingly healthy companies were priced at higher rates  and had trouble selling.Commercial paper, essentially a promise to repay a loan within a few weeks to nine months, has served as a major pipeline for corporate financing. Mortgage lenders use the short-term notes to fund their loans before packaging and offloading them from their books.Hedge funds created special investment vehicles, which purchased the short-term notes to invest in higher-yielding loans  often mortgage bonds  and then used the difference to bolster their returns. And many corporations used commercial paper to finance big share-buyback programs.Investors in money market funds have found commercial paper a convenient place to park their cash. While some big money market funds may improve their returns if they can invest at the current rates, others may be worse off. But most ordinary investors, bankers and analysts say, should not see much of an impact.“Investment managers and portfolio managers who deal with hundreds of millions of dollars are very concerned, but the average investor should not be worried,” said Peter Crane, the publisher of Money Fund Intelligence, an industry newsletter. He said there was almost “zero chance” that a money market fund would decline significantly in value.While the turbulence of the commercial paper market peaked on Thursday, it was still not fully stabilized yesterday.Investors have grown increasingly scared that the high-grade notes are backed by bundles of subprime mortgages. So much so, they do not trust the credit ratings of many short-term notes  including ones that the major agencies deemed high grade.About $1.2 trillion, or roughly 53 percent of commercial paper, is backed by pools of assets like home mortgages, credit card receivables and car loans. Over all, some analysts suggested, about half is backed by residential mortgages.But several said that most investors have no idea of their actual subprime exposure in that mix.Transparency has been poor. And because of high-octane financial engineering, analysts said, the underlying pool of assets may have been rated as high quality but could actually be backed by riskier stuff.The widespread uncertainty has frozen parts of the commercial paper market and led to days of turbulent trading. As it reverberates, many players in the financial systems are feeling its effects.To be sure, many short-term notes are trading  although at record high rates. But as issuers have to come up with cash to roll over, or refinance their notes, they have found themselves unable to do so. That is because the underlying pool of assets is worth considerably less.On some notes many issuers have invoked so-called extendable options, which lengthen the payback period from, say, 90 days to six months in an effort to wait for extra time for investors to come back. Others have turned to so-called backstop financing  essentially an insurance policy sold by the big banks and brokerage houses that calls for them to provide funding if the underlying assets cannot be sold. Countrywide, for example, tapped its $11.5 billion credit line yesterday after investors were reluctant to buy its commercial paper. The move allowed Countrywide to stave off selling the underlying mortgage assets at deep discounts.But the total amount of rescue financing has placed tens of billions of dollars at risk for many of the biggest banks. Most charge nominal fees for the guarantee of liquidity, analysts said, and some banks did not properly reserve for the risk since the prospect of default seemed remote.Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, for example, have guaranteed more than $90 billion of liquidity, or about 5 or 6 percent of their total assets, according to a recent Banc of America Securities report. State Street, a custody bank, guaranteed about $29 billion, or 23 percent of its total assets.In all three cases, their actual subprime mortgage exposure is proportionally small. But other analysts suggest that many big European banks may carry a great deal more risk on their balance sheet.That has ignited fear that the subprime contagion has spread to the global banking system  and, some suggest, caused the Federal Reserve Board to take action yesterday.“The Fed is concerned because of the banks’ exposure. The banks are on the hook for potentially tens of billions of dollars,” said Christian Stracke, an analyst at CreditSights, a fixed-income research firm. “That could tighten credit conditions significantly if all that paper is tied up in things that none of the banks want to hold.”"
23,"This should have been Edward M. Gramlich’s moment.For more than a decade, even before he was named a governor of the Federal Reserve Board in 1997, Mr. Gramlich was warning of dangers in the housing market, a stance that has made him a sought-after expert in the current crisis.As chairman of the Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation, he urged legislators to better protect consumers against predatory lenders, and toughen regulation of mortgage lenders and banks. Nonetheless, his efforts met resistance within the Fed and on Capitol Hill, and even he admits he could have pushed earlier for reform.Still, in June, he published a timely book, “Subprime Mortgages: America’s Latest Boom and Bust,” that has linked his name once more to the home loan situation, which he says he never could have expected would become so dire.By rights, Mr. Gramlich would be entitled to be at the center of the debate. But instead, he is fighting for his life.After falling ill during a trip to Africa in March, he was diagnosed withacute myeloid leukemia, an advanced cancer of the white blood cells, for which treatment is arduous and survival rates low.It is his second bout with the disease. In 2002, while at the Federal Reserve, he was diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia, a more treatable form of blood cancer. After chemotherapy, he went into remission.Mr. Gramlich, 68, has been offered a highly experimental treatment, overseen by his doctors at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore, to help fight his new cancer, for which he already has undergone one round of procedures. But he has decided to forgo it, at least for now.Though doctors cannot say with certainty how long he will live without the therapy, his wife estimates it may be no more than a few months.“It’s a hard decision,” Mr. Gramlich, known as Ned, said in a telephone interview this week from his home in Washington (unable to go out in crowds, he now sees few visitors except family). “This whole thing, I have to say, is tremendously unfair, that it hit. But it did hit, and what do you do now? You make the best of it.”As to be expected from the author of a book on cost-benefit analysis, as well as the former chairman of the federal loan board for the airline industry, Mr. Gramlich is weighing the pros and cons of his own situation with an economist’s detachment.In this case, he balanced the quality of life, or lack thereof, that the treatment might afford. “It’s a great maybe,” Mr. Gramlich said.With remission unlikely, the experimental treatment might extend his life, “but maybe not, and it could shorten it,” he said. Moreover, Mr. Gramlich, who is already weak from his disease, was told he would probably become even sicker as the treatment progressed.“I just didn’t want to do it,” Mr. Gramlich said. He added that he might consider other treatment options, but he and his wife also plan to investigate hospice care soon.Though his decision was made pragmatically, it has still shaken his friends. “For him to talk about going out is a lot easier than it is for all of us,” said Roger W. Ferguson, a former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve who served with Mr. Gramlich, and is now chairman of Swiss Re America Holding, the United States branch of the global insurer.But Mr. Gramlich’s conclusion was “in character” with his analytical side, Mr. Ferguson added.Mr. Gramlich’s decisions recall those of the author and political columnist Art Buchwald. In February 2006, he chose to discontinue receiving dialysis for kidney disease.Although told he might be dead within weeks, Mr. Buchwald lived on for nearly a year, writing another book, and playing host to famous friends at his hospice bedside. He died in January, and marked his passing with avideo obituaryfor The New York Times’s Web site that began with this declaration: “I’m Art Buchwald, and I just died!”Mr. Gramlich acknowledged the similarities: “He essentially made the decision that treatment was awful, he couldn’t abide it, and so, to hell with it, let’s see what happens.”While not approaching his fate with quite so much humor, Mr. Gramlich is displaying at least as much candor.This month, he and his wife, Ruth, shared his decision not to seek further experimental treatment in a newsletter they had posted on a Web site calledCarePages, which allows patients to update family and friends about their treatment, and receive messages of support.More than 350 people have logged in to read Mr. Gramlich’s CarePage, which Mrs. Gramlich said had spared the family the time and emotional trauma of notifying people themselves.“You’re overwhelmed by caring people who want to know what’s going on,” Mrs. Gramlich said.Readers have included family friends, former government colleagues and associates at the University of Michigan, where Mr. Gramlich served as dean of its public policy school and, more recently, as acting provost in 2005 and 2006.Along with health updates, the entries have shared the family’s emotional frustration.“We were brought up by the older generation to be much less forthcoming about these things, both the facts and the emotions,” Mrs. Gramlich said.With close friends, “Ned and I would be absolutely honest that this is incurable; it also would be dishonest not to say we’re sad and devastated.”But his illness has not yet prevented Mr. Gramlich from having his say about the housing market, an interest of his that predates his years at the Fed.While there, he spoke frequently about the boom in home prices that took place earlier this decade, warning that loans by predatory lenders to low-income buyers were not receiving enough scrutiny.Their practices, like charging excessive fees and refinancing for the sole purpose of collecting more fees, “jeopardize the twin American dreams of owning a home and building wealth,” he said in a 2002 speech.Mr. Gramlich said that upon leaving the Fed two years ago, he had planned to write about the housing boom. But his tenure at Michigan intervened, and by the time he completed the manuscript last December, the subprime market was on its way to collapsing, fulfilling his worst policy fears.Last month, despite his obvious poor health,he spoke at lengthabout potential solutions during a televised panel sponsored by the Urban Institute; he is a senior fellow there, and the institute published his book. (The group’s president, Robert Reischauer, said of Mr. Gramlich: “Ned is to the policy community what an Olympic gold medal decathlete is to the world of sports.”)He voiced a repeated theme, that more regulation of subprime lenders is needed from the Fed and other agencies. Lately, that is a point the Federal Reserve has made, “but they seem to be alone,” Mr. Gramlich said.Rather than watch troubled borrowers flounder, he would like to see community groups help them avoid foreclosure, and even purchase homes that could be sold to low-income borrowers. “With very small amounts of money, they could do a world of good,” he said.He noted the incongruity of the timing of his illness, coming just as an issue so important to him had become front-of-mind for many policy makers. “It’s good news and bad news,” Mr. Gramlich said.On the downside, his illness is preventing him from making many more appearances to promote his book, since he is susceptible to infection.But the good news “is that the last thing I ever did was really important,” Mr. Gramlich said. “I really feel I got it right at the end.”"
24,"The Federal Reserve, saying for the first time that the recent disorder in the financial markets has raised the risk of an economic downturn, took the unusual step yesterday of encouraging the nation’s banks to borrow directly from the Fed, particularly to support home mortgage lending.The early morning announcement of a drop in the so-called discount rate, made even before the stock market opened, sent Wall Street soaring as relieved investors celebrated the Fed’s tacit acknowledgment that it had made a mistake last week in playing down concerns over the spreading distress in the credit markets. After falling for six straight days, the Dow Jones industrial average shot up 233.30 points, to 13,079.08, a 1.8 percent increase.The Fed, while not yet cutting a rate that wields more influence over the economy, moved to stimulate lending in part because it recognized that even well-to-do families with good credit ratings were having difficulty getting mortgages. That problem, radiating through the housing market and then the broader economy, had “the potential to restrain economic growth,” the Fed said.The sudden action also suggested that the nation’s central bankers were worried that a major financial institution might be at risk of failure if the Fed did not move before its policy makers gather for their next regular meeting, on Sept. 18.Analysts predicted that the Fed was likely to go further, cutting market interest rates soon, perhaps even before its meeting next month if its action yesterday does not help to shore up confidence on Wall Street and elsewhere in the economy.The mechanism for lifting the mortgage market was a cut of half a percentage point, to 5.75 percent, on borrowing from the discount window, a normally rare practice in which the Fed lends directly to banks facing some sort of trouble.“We want to make it very clear that we are happy to lend,” one Fed policy maker said, “and we are eager for banks to use the discount window.”In a conference call yesterday, Fed officials told major banks that discount window borrowing would be viewed as a sign of strength, not weakness.Just the way in which the Fed acted showed how quickly its previous concerns about the greater risk of inflation had evaporated. The Fed’s standard practice, for more than a decade, has been to change rates and issue statements only at scheduled meetings of policy makers. Inter-meeting actions only underscore the dire nature of the situation.But as stock prices moved wildly once again on Thursday, the Fed’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, convened a 6 p.m. teleconference call, and after an hour of discussion, the 10 policy makers present voted unanimously for the discount rate cut and for an assessment of the economy clearly more negative than the upbeat one issued just 10 days earlier.That earlier statement, issued after the Fed’s Aug. 7 meeting, said that the economy “seems likely to continue to expand at a moderate pace over coming quarters.” The new description repeated the view that the economy would expand at a “moderate pace,” but added “that the downside risks to growth have increased appreciably.”William Poole, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, was missing from the conference call and Fed officials explained carefully to reporters that he was absent only because of a conflict with a long-scheduled dinner appearance, adding that suddenly canceling that appearance might alarm the marketplace. Mr. Poole has publicly opposed a cut in the federal funds rate.Indeed, no change was made yesterday in the more important federal funds rate, which the Fed uses as its main policy tool, cutting it to stimulate a flagging economy or raising it to rein in a potentially inflationary one. Still, yesterday’s action suggested that the funds rate itself — which directly affects what businesses pays for loans and what ordinary Americans pay for home equity borrowing, car loans and various other consumer credit — would soon be cut.“What the Fed is really saying is that this recovery is more in danger than it has been since it started nearly six years ago,” said Jan Hatzius, chief United States economist for Goldman Sachs, who predicted an initial cut in the funds rate to 5 percent, from the present 5.25 percent.The discount move, coupled with formal acknowledgment that the economy might be in trouble, represents Mr. Bernanke’s boldest attempts to relieve the financial crisis, his first real test since becoming Fed chairman 18 months ago.The Fed’s admission that the economy might not be so healthy suggested to Mr. Hatzius and others on Wall Street that an initial cut in the federal funds rate, which has been at 5.25 percent for nearly 14 months, could be followed by several more in the months ahead as the Fed braces for the possibility of a weakening economy, dragged down by a shrinking housing market.“This is a watershed statement from the Fed to let the markets and politicians know that the Fed is prepared to act as needed,” Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services Group, wrote in a note to clients.Fed policy makers and Treasury officials said that in cutting the discount rate, the Fed’s principal goal was to shore up the market for creditworthy mortgages, including those for more expensive homes.While that market is primarily for more affluent borrowers, Fed officials said they were worried that average Americans would suffer, too, if the troubles in the so-called jumbo mortgage market infected the rest of the economy. The collapse of so many subprime mortgage securities had spread to the larger market, and lenders of high-quality mortgages were having trouble selling the loans they made.So the Fed said to the banks in effect: borrow at the discount window, using the mortgages as collateral, at a rate of 5.75 percent, down from 6.25 percent. Moreover, banks were encouraged, if necessary, to roll over the loans every 30 days, an easing of the usual 24-hour rule.That brought the discount window into the financial crisis, which the Fed, until yesterday, had dealt with in a different manner. It did so by adding billions of dollars to the banking system, to keep the federal funds rate at 5.25 percent. This is the interest that banks and other lending institutions pay to borrow from each other to finance their operations.In the midst of the crisis, the federal funds rate spiked to a level above 6 percent.Cutting it will inevitably raise the charge that the Fed is bailing out hedge funds and others who borrowed billions of dollars to invest in subprime mortgages, ignoring the risk that many of the low-income households who got these mortgages would default.Lower interest rates raise the odds that risk takers can sell bad investments with less of a loss.“You would be mitigating their problems,” said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist and a former Fed governor, but “I would count that as a social cost of saving the economy.”What remains unclear is how much damage, if any, the economy has suffered from the market turmoil. The Fed promised “to act as needed to mitigate the adverse effects,” but data documenting any damage takes weeks to collect.Home construction is clearly down, and recent economic reports show that consumption has weakened since the first quarter.“If there was evidence of a significant decline in spending, that would induce the Fed to cut rates, but there is no evidence of a significant decline in spending,” said Mark Gertler, a New York University economist who did research with Mr. Bernanke when the Fed chairman was a Princeton professor.The earliest damage would show up in consumer sentiment. The University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers released a poll yesterday showing that Americans were somewhat more pessimistic because of costly food and fuel, not the unfolding financial crisis. “People have not yet begun to calculate how the market turmoil might affect their own situation,” said Richard T. Curtain, director of the Michigan survey. “That is still in the future, if it ever happens.”"
25,"MORTGAGE lenders aren’t the only ones reassessing their appetite for risk. So, too, are equity investors, many of whom have been oblivious to the concept of risk in recent years, thanks to what had been a beneficent bull market.But the recent troubles in the subprime mortgage market have changed all that.Rising mortgage delinquencies have roiled some hedge funds and institutional owners of mortgage-backed securities, and the equity markets have suffered sympathy pains — leading to a drop that at its worst moment last week amounted to more than 1,100 points in the Dow Jones industrial average.And last week, there was yet another round of hand-wringing on Wall Street as several mortgage companies had difficulty raising funds in the credit market. But on Friday, the Federal Reserve took action to ease some of those fears by lowering the discount rate, the interest rate that it charges for short-term bank loans, by half a percentage point. And the Fed said it was prepared to take further action if needed. Still, it’s clear that stock investors have lowered their assessment of riskier investments, said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. There’s still a question hanging over the market. “It’s whether this shift is aggressive enough and persistent enough to affect how this market cycle turns out,” he said.While it’s impossible to know whether this will turn out to be just another short-term scare — like previous sell-offs, in late February and in May 2006 — or if this is the start something bigger, investors would be wise to reassess their exposure to risk, financial planners say.That’s because once the market loses its appetite for risky assets, investors “tend to throw out the babies with the bath water,” said Ronald W. Rogé, a financial planner in Bohemia, N.Y.Where are equity investors most vulnerable? Financial planners and market strategists point to at least three basic areas:SMALL-COMPANY STOCKSAt the start of 2000, the typical retirement investor held $1 in small-capitalization stocks for every $16 invested in large, blue-chip shares, according to Hewitt Associates, the employee benefit research firm in Lincolnshire, Ill. But by July this year, that ratio had shrunk to just 1 to 3.6, as investors chased hot-performing small-cap stocks — and as those shares grew faster than the broader market.This portfolio allocation may be putting investors in a precarious position. “The sword cuts both ways,” said Greg Schultz, a principal at Asset Allocation Advisors, a financial planning firm in Walnut Creek, Calif. Though small-cap stocks tend to climb faster than blue chips in a market upswing, they also tend to lose ground more quickly in a market downturn.Indeed, since the start of July, large stocks, as measured by the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, have fallen 3.8 percent while small stocks in the Russell 2000 have lost 5.7 percent.And there’s another reason to fear overexposure to small stocks: many savings institutions — those traditionally classified as savings and loans — are small-cap companies, and many of them have been buffeted by the mortgage debacle. In fact, a recent analysis by Morningstar showed that while 67 percent of large-cap stock funds have some exposure to these savings institutions, 88 percent of small-cap funds are so exposed. And this financial industry group has been among the worst-performing so far this year, down nearly 18 percent, on average.FINANCIAL SECTOR STOCKSNo sector of the economy is more vulnerable to the current mortgage crisis than the financial services industry. And no sector accounts for a larger slice of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. At the end of last year, financial companies represented a record 22.3 percent of the S.& P. 500. That was up from 7.5 percent at the end of 1990.To be sure, there was never a bubble in this sector, as there was in technology in the late 1990s. Indeed, financial stocks in the S.& P. 500 now trade at a lower price-to-earnings ratio than the broad market. That was certainly not the case for tech in 1999.But there is still a potential problem, if only because the sector represents such a wide swath of the market. If your domestic stock portfolio mimics the broad market, more than one-fifth of your holdings are in this sector just as this credit crisis is unfolding.“I think it’s going to be guilt by association,” said Christopher Orndorff, head of equity strategy at Payden & Rygel, an asset manager in Los Angeles. “Financial firms will be presumed guilty” when it comes to their exposure to the subprime crisis until they prove themselves innocent, he said.Mr. Orndorff added: “This is no time to go bargain-hunting in financials.”EMERGING-MARKET STOCKSDespite its lack of exposure to the domestic mortgage crisis, the average diversified emerging-market stock fund has lost 16.4 percent of its value over the past month. That’s more than the average financial sector fund has lost.That is to be expected, said James A. Shambo, a financial planner in Colorado Springs. “Some folks will flee risk in general because they don’t understand what’s going on.”Mr. Shambo says he’s not sure that the credit crunch means the end of investors’ five-year love affair with emerging-market stocks. But eventually, he said, the performance of emerging-market stocks will slow and return to historical norms. And when that happens, the “emerging markets will be affected in their own right.”Though emerging-market stock funds have produced enviable annualized gains of nearly 28 percent over the past five years, investors forget that these same funds lost money in five of the six years from 1997 to 2002.Now, the average investor in a 401(k) retirement plan holds only 1.3 percent of his or her assets in emerging-market equities. “But the average can be very deceptive,” said Pamela Hess, Hewitt’s director of retirement research.Of those 401(k) participants who invested any of their money in the emerging markets, Ms. Hess noted, the typical allocation is 16.4 percent, according to a study Hewitt conducted last year.In many cases, investors may have started with a much more modest exposure to emerging markets, she said. But by failing to rebalance their accounts in recent years, some investors allowed their allocations to this and other risky asset classes to explode.The concern is now this: Will those risky assets blow up investors’ portfolios now that the market has a new-found aversion to risk?"
26,"All through last year, Jim Melcher saw the signs of a rapidly deteriorating American housing market — riskier mortgages, rising delinquencies and more homes falling into foreclosure. And with $100 million in assets at his hedge fund, Balestra Capital, he was in a position to do something about it.So in October, as mortgage-backed bonds were still flying high, he bet $10 million that these bonds would plunge in value, using complex derivatives available to any institutional investor. As his gamble began to pay off in the first months of 2007, Mr. Melcher, a money manager based in New York, plowed the profits into ever bigger wagers that the mortgage crisis would worsen further, eventually risking some $60 million of the fund’s money.“We saw the opportunity of a lifetime, and since then events have unfolded on schedule,” he said. Mr. Melcher’s flagship fund has since doubled in value, even as this summer’s market turmoil cost other investors billions, forced the closing of several major hedge funds and pushed the stock market down 7 percent since mid-July. This week, Mr. Melcher is heading to Paris for a vacation with his wife.The extent of the turmoil has stunned much of Wall Street, but as Mr. Melcher’s case makes clear, there were ample warning signs that a financial time bomb in the form of subprime mortgages was ticking quietly for months, if not years.As far back as 2001, advocates for low-income homeowners had argued that mortgage providers were making loans to borrowers without regard to their ability to repay. Many could not even scrape together the money for a down payment and were being approved with little or no documentation of their income or assets.In December, the first subprime lenders started failing as more borrowers began falling behind on payments, often shortly after they received the loans. And in February, HSBC, the large British bank, set aside $1.76 billion because of problems in its American subprime lending business.Over the last two weeks, this slowly building wave became a tsunami in the global financial markets.On Friday, the Federal Reserve was forced into a surprise cut of the discount rate it charges banks to borrow money, a move that steadied shaky stock and credit markets and reassured investors, bankers and traders who were reeling from a month of market turmoil. And for the first time, the Fed bluntly acknowledged that the credit crisis posed a threat to economic growth.“Until recently, there was a lot of denial, but this is a big deal,” said Byron R. Wien, a 40-year veteran of Wall Street who is now chief investment strategist at Pequot Capital. “Now the big question is: Will this spill over into the broader economy?”The answer to that question will be revealed over the coming months. But the cast of characters who missed signals like the rise of delinquencies and foreclosures is becoming easier to identify. They include investment banks happy to sell risky but lucrative mortgage debt to hedge funds hungry for high interest payments, bond rating agencies willing to hope for the best in the housing market and provide sterling credit appraisals to debt issuers, and subprime mortgage brokers addicted to high sales volumes.What is more, some of these players now find themselves in a dual role as both enabler and victim, like the legions of individual borrowers who were convinced that their homes could only keep rising in value and were confident that they could afford to stretch for the biggest mortgage possible.“All of the old-timers knew that subprime mortgages were what we called neutron loans — they killed the people and left the houses,” said Louis S. Barnes, 58, a partner at Boulder West, a mortgage banking firm in Lafayette, Colo. “The deals made in 2005 and 2006 were going to run into trouble because the credit pendulum at the time was stuck at easy.”Oddly, the credit analysts at brokerage firms now being pummeled were among the Cassandras whose warnings were not heeded. “I’m one guy in a research department, but many people in our mortgage team have been suggesting that there was froth within the market,” said Jack Malvey, the chief global fixed income strategist for Lehman Brothers. “This has really been progressing for quite some time.”Others on Wall Street echoed Mr. Malvey’s stance. “We’ve contended for a while that there was an issue in subprime debt,” said Neal Shear, global head of trading at Morgan Stanley. “A year ago, we were aware that delinquencies were going to rise.”A Ripple ExpandsSo why did many of the smartest minds on Wall Street somehow miss the signposts that these insiders now claim to have seen coming?Few professionals on the losing end of these trades are willing to talk publicly about how what started out as a crisis in an obscure corner of the credit market — subprime debt, for borrowers with weak credit — managed to infect stocks and bonds. For example, officials at Goldman Sachs, Wall Street’s most dominant firm, have provided little detail into how one of their hedge funds lost 30 percent of its value in just weeks.But the precipitous fall in the value of mortgage-backed bonds was spurred by a mad rush by so many holders to dump them simultaneously. That is because they might not have understood what they were buying in the first place, instead focusing only on the bonds’ higher yields. Unlike Mr. Melcher, they had not considered the circumstances under which the risky mortgages they essentially owned had been granted.“Buyers didn’t fully understand what they were getting,” said Rajiv Sobti, a portfolio manager at Proxima Alfa Investments, a New York hedge fund. In Wall Street parlance, Mr. Sobti added, “They were sold, not bought. The actual buyers were often not mortgage specialists, but generalists who looked at these bonds as a way of earning higher yields.”Once the mortgage-backed bonds finally started plunging for the very reasons Mr. Melcher spotted long before, the dominoes moved swiftly. Hedge funds and other holders of this risky debt also began to sell more solid investments like corporate bonds and even stocks in an effort to raise money. These hedge funds, in turn, were under pressure from their own backers to return their investments. The same was true for the Wall Street brokerage houses that had provided them with credit.The blame game is already beginning. The spotlight will focus first on rating agencies like Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, because the mortgage-backed bonds that plunged in value in recent weeks were highly rated by these agencies until they downgraded billions worth of them in July.A Toll on the EconomyOther companies face far more immediate problems. Countrywide Financial, the nation’s largest independent mortgage lender, found itself fending off reports this month that bankruptcy could be looming as its stock plunged 41 percent.Yet as recently as March, Angelo R. Mozilo, the chief executive of Countrywide, appeared on CNBC and proclaimed that worries about the subprime sector were “clearly an overreaction.” He promised that “this will be great for Countrywide at the end of the day, because all the irrational competitors will be gone.”Along with chief executives like Mr. Mozilo, central bankers also apparently failed to anticipate the threat posed by subprime debt. In a May 17 speech in Chicago, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, acknowledged the “recent sharp increases in subprime mortgage loan delinquencies.”But he said, “we do not expect significant spillovers from the subprime market to the rest of the economy or to the financial system.”That same month, a former Federal Reserve governor, Edward M. Gramlich, was preparing to publish a book titled, “Subprime Mortgages: America’s Latest Boom and Bust.” Even earlier, in April, the usually bullish National Association of Realtors said that home prices across the country would decline in 2007 because of the widening fallout from subprime loans. And in March, the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a banking regulator, had urged Congress to create standards to protect borrowers with poor credit.Federal regulators did eventually tighten lending standards on June 29, but by then the meltdown on Wall Street was already in progress. Exactly one week earlier, Bear Stearns disclosed that two hedge funds specializing in subprime debt run by its asset management arm were facing a sudden wave of withdrawals by investors, the hedge-fund equivalent of a run on the bank.“This was the match that lit a very dry field of risk on fire,” Mr. Malvey said. When he first heard the news coming out of Bear Stearns, Mr. Malvey recalled, he was busy writing his weekly report to clients in his corner office on the 15th floor of Lehman’s Midtown Manhattan headquarters. Now it seemed as if the broader market was catching up to what Mr. Malvey and his team had been talking about all along.Bear Stearns’ failure to sense the early tremors was especially glaring. In 2006, it was rated as the best risk manager among United States brokerage firms in 2006 by Euromoney, a respected trade publication. Unlike other firms, though, Bear’s problems eventually claimed a high-profile casualty — in early August, the brokerage firm’s co-president and heir apparent, Warren J. Spector, was forced to resign.The company has emphasized that in spite of the damage to its reputation, its actual financial losses were relatively small.Within weeks after the Bear Stearns disclosure, the action shifted to the rating agencies. On July 10, Standard & Poor’s announced it was downgrading $7.3 billion worth of securities sold in late 2005 and 2006, and the ensuing conference call quickly turned testy. Steven Eisman, a portfolio manager at Front Point Partners, an investment firm that had made a major bet against the subprime mortgage market, did not mince words.“I’d like to know why now?” Mr. Eisman demanded to know. “Why didn’t you do this many, many months ago?”Regulatory ScrutinyThe European Union says it plans to examine the agencies’ role in the debacle and investigate possible conflicts of interest between the agencies and the issuers of mortgage bonds.In Washington, Representative Barney Frank, the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, is planning hearings in October that will also examine this issue. “The fact is the rating agencies didn’t do a very good job,” Mr. Frank said. “They had no way of knowing whether some of the loans were imprudently granted.”In a written statement, Chris Atkins, a spokesman for Standard & Poor’s, said that for 18 months leading up to July 10 the company had been adjusting its assumptions about the housing market, downgrading selected bonds and publicly highlighting potential problems. Even in light of the crisis, S.& P. expects that only the riskiest mortgage bonds could default and that holders of securities with its top AAA rating will continue to receive interest and principal payments.“Our concerns and actions have coincided with the worst housing recession in recent history set against a backdrop of loosened lending practices,” Mr. Atkins said. Still, Mr. Atkins seemed to acknowledge that his company was also caught by surprise.“The market continues to deteriorate, with the level of loss continuing to exceed historical precedents and our initial expectations,” he said.Some mortgage executives take a different view. Larry A. Goldstone, president of Thornburg Mortgage, said the trajectory of the current crisis in subprime closely resembled the arc of past mortgage crunches. Thornburg is not a subprime issuer, but like Countrywide it was also hit with rumors that it could go under last week.“I’ve been in this business since 1983, and this is the fourth time we’ve had this in subprime,” said Mr. Goldstone, ticking off similar squeezes in 1987, 1993 and 1998. Maybe so, but what is different now is how much bigger the subprime market is than in the past, totaling $600 billion last year, up from $120 billion in 2001, according to Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade journal.To make matters worse, all borrowers are now likely to face higher borrowing costs for years to come, even those with stellar credit histories. Already, mortgages of more than $417,000, known as jumbos, carry interest rates of 7.5 percent to 8 percent, up from 6.5 percent last month.“It’s going to come down a little, but it won’t go back to 6.5 percent,” Mr. Goldstone said. He also predicts the rate of about 6.25 percent on smaller government-backed mortgages will probably rise to 7 percent. That may not sound like much, but for a homebuyer borrowing $400,000, the higher rate means $200 more in monthly payments.There are signs that this added burden is already having an effect on the economy. Last week, the nation’s two largest retailers — Wal-Mart and Home Depot — stoked those fears when they reported disappointing earnings and warned that consumer spending was slowing as a result of the weakness in the housing sector. New car purchases have also been slipping, and earlier this month General Motors and Ford lowered their sales forecasts for 2007.Although Mr. Malvey believes the short-term turmoil in the stock and bond markets will subside by the fall, he said the added financial strain on homebuyers increases the odds of a recession in 2008 or 2009. That, in turn, makes it more likely that the Federal Reserve will announce a cut in its benchmark rate when it next meets on Sept. 18, Mr. Malvey said.And while the Fed’s rate cut on Friday will help stabilize the overall credit and equity markets in the near term, it will take months for the benefits to filter down to individual borrowers.“This will have no effect on local market conditions,” Mr. Barnes said. “While smaller government-backed loans and mortgages for extremely high-quality borrowers are available, everything else is very hard to get it.” As for no-money-down loans, he said, rates now stand at 10 percent, in the unlikely event that they can be found.In the coming months, foreclosures are expected to keep mounting.What is more, the interest rates on the subprime mortgages offered to homebuyers in 2005 and 2006, when credit standards were at their most lax, will soon begin to rise, forcing up monthly payments for the weakest borrowers practically overnight. As a result, Mr. Goldstone predicts that banks and other lenders could eventually see losses reach into the tens of billions.Homebuyers AffectedNow, some would-be buyers like Matthew Hennig are having to put off their dream of homeownership. In early July, Mr. Hennig, an air-conditioner repairman, signed the contract to buy his ideal home, a two-bedroom condo overlooking a swimming pool in a Phoenix suburb.A day later, however, as he was on the job in a sweltering attic, his loan officer at Fairway Independent Mortgage called to tell him that the $185,000, no-money-down loan Mr. Hennig thought was a sure thing had been denied. Why? He was a first-time buyer with little credit history.Unlike the professionals on the trading floors of Wall Street who lost billions and now seem shell-shocked, Mr. Hennig has moved on. Mr. Hennig, who earns about $40,000 a year, is now renting a room from a friend and saving up the money for a down payment when he tries to buy again in a year or so. He has also recently opened a charge-card account to bolster his credit score.If Mr. Hennig does eventually get a mortgage, however, his monthly payment could well be higher, because of the same factors Mr. Melcher first noticed long ago. “This is the first time I have ever tried to buy anything,” he said. “It is just my luck.”"
27,"Measuring the Subprime MessTo the Editor:Re “Chicken Little’s Brethren, on the Trading Floor” (Everybody’s Business, Aug. 12), in which Ben Stein saw much overreaction to the subprime mortgage problem:I have a different take on the market events of Friday, Aug. 10. In my view, when the Federal Reserve intervenes to inject liquidity into the market, in the form of many billions of dollars, and the European Central Bank ponies up even more, so to avoid a financial crisis, that is breathtaking.And when such action could help some major financial stocks to finish that week on the upside, that is outrageous. It’s another reason for Europe to object to our practices, and I and my children will pay for such folly. Dennis R. WanlessBurlington, N.C., Aug. 13To the Editor:The current crisis in the subprime mortgage market doesn’t stand alone in causing the global market malaise. However, it is a concrete example of the wisdom in the axiom, “Trees don’t grow to the sky.” Not trees, or prices for homes, either.Then we look to another idea  that by the part shall you know the whole. The “part” here is the madness of subprime mortgages. What then can we surmise about the banks that made them, and the hedge funds that bought them? And what of the health, pension, and public trust funds that put their money into those hedge funds? What further “surprises” are in store?Allow me to go from axiom to platitude: “You ain’t seen nothin’ yet.” Richard RobertsParis, Aug. 13To the Editor:Like the dot-com era, the subprime bubble period was the proverbial “emperor with no clothes.” The investment model was not based on sound fundamentals. This is a natural correction and, in the long run, good for all.Fund analysts could have, or should have, seen the eventual effects of these lending practices. I think that many of the stock-market bulls yearn for the good old days of “irrational exuberance.” Martin WhalenMillington, N.J., Aug. 13"

29,"WASHINGTON —As questions begin, Bernanke's past provides glimpse into Fed chairman's thinking in his first crisisFor the past month, stock markets worldwide have gyrated as every other day seemingly has brought more bad news about the U.S. housing and credit markets. Traders awaited a signal from the U.S. Federal Reserve and its chairman, Ben Bernanke, now in his sophomore year at the helm of the central bank.On Aug. 7, Wall Street got its first answer. The Fed said in a statement that it was watching the housing meltdown with concern but that it believed that the broader economy was on a steady path of growth. The words did nothing to calm the markets.Ten days later, the Fed dramatically changed its tone. In an extraordinary action between board meetings, the Fed lowered one of the two interest rates it controls and issued a statement expressing concern about the markets and the possibility of a downturn in the economy.Bernanke was clearly behind both statements, and some economists and traders shook their heads at the apparent flip-flop. But Bernanke, a student, if not necessarily a devotee, of the British economist John Maynard Keynes, was probably mindful of a remark Keynes made after being accused of reversing his views on government intervention in markets during the Great Depression.""When the facts change, I change my mind,"" Keynes said. ""What do you do, sir?""Bernanke, grappling with his first crisis since taking over as Fed chairman in February 2006, is being watched intently to see how he handles the reins of the economy.Although a Republican who served briefly on the White House economic team of President George W. Bush, Bernanke has shown himself to be no laissez-faire ideologue or partisan gunslinger.Where Bernanke came from and how he formed his beliefs may explain his thinking early when markets began to tumble. The past could also offer a glimpse into his mentality as the global economy stages a comeback - or if it sinks further.Bernanke came to government from one of the tallest spires of the ivory tower, the chairmanship of the economics department at Princeton University. He earned his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where his adviser was Stanley Fischer, a former No. 2 official at the International Monetary Fund and currently the governor of the Bank of Israel.But to understand Bernanke's worldview, one must go back to Dillon, South Carolina, his hometown.Bernanke, 53, grew up in Dillon in the 1950s and '60s, the son of the local pharmacist and a member of one of the few Jewish families in the largely agricultural region known as the Pee Dee, after a local river. He says his home was the only kosher household in a 50-mile, or 80-kilometer, radius.Being a member of a distinct minority taught him about discrimination and prejudice. ""There was more than one request to see my horns,"" he said years later.He also watched the struggles of small farmers, who drove mule-drawn carts down the main street and had trouble paying their bills, even in good years. His father granted credit for purchases at the drugstore, keeping records on small cards in a drawer. Many of the debts were never repaid. As Bernanke grew older, the textile mills that had supported the area for more than a century closed and moved overseas in search of low-cost labor.Bernanke worked construction jobs and was a waiter while an undergraduate at Harvard University.""I was impressed by these experiences,"" Bernanke said last autumn at a ceremony in his honor on the steps of the neo-Classical courthouse in Dillon, ""and I think they were an important reason I went into economics, which a great economist once called the study of people in the ordinary business of life.""He has written extensively about the Great Depression and the policy blunders made by the Federal Reserve that spread the distress. Asked to explain his fascination with the Depression he said: ""If you want to understand geology, study earthquakes. If you want to understand the economy, study the Depression.""Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, said that Bernanke's studies of the Depression and other financial catastrophes had taught him that the Fed's role was not only to keep inflation in check, but also to deal with upheavals in the markets. But Yardeni said that Bernanke might have misread the signs that the markets were sending and acted too timidly at first. He said the statement Aug. 7 offered too rosy an outlook for the economy.""That's really where there was a credibility issue,"" he said. ""At that point, most observers had already come to the conclusion that things were coming unglued pretty rapidly and the Fed had to act.""Bernanke's compassion for the common man has not made him a populist or a protectionist, nor even a Democrat. His study of economics has led him to believe that free markets and unfettered trade offer the greatest opportunity for the greatest number of people. But in a speech on growing income inequality earlier this year, he endorsed programs to provide job retraining for displaced workers and new laws to improve the portability of health and pension benefits between employers.As central banker for the world's largest economy, Bernanke's freedom of speech is circumscribed by custom and by the magnified effect his words have on global markets. He will not talk about the value of the dollar or future interest rate decisions or specific tax or budget measures. Less than three months into the job, Bernanke stubbed his toe by casually telling Maria Bartiromo of the cable financial network CNBC that Wall Street had misread the Fed's signals, touching off a market frenzy.Since those first few months of the ""break-in period,"" as Bernanke calls them, he has been much more circumspect.Still, it is possible to discern something of his roots and his inclinations from his speeches and congressional testimony. During a speech last autumn in Washington, he expressed worry that the short-sightedness of the current generation would weaken the Social Security retirement system and the Medicare health benefits system for older Americans for their children and grandchildren.In a commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he delivered a rather dry lecture on the relationship between technological change and productivity growth.But he also told graduates, ""The world has more to offer than money"" and encouraged them to pursue offbeat careers, charitable work and public service jobs.In June, in remarks on the troubles in the housing and subprime lending markets, Bernanke voiced sympathy for homeowners who had been foreclosed or unable to obtain new loans. He said that it was difficult to predict how widely the problem would spread but expressed confidence in the underlying economy.""At this point,"" he said on June 5, ""the troubles in the subprime sector seem unlikely to seriously spill over to the broader economy or the financial system."" The Fed held to that position, publicly at least, through two more months of turmoil.Kenneth Manning, a professor of the history of science at MIT who graduated from high school in Dillon four years before Bernanke, predicted that his friend would excel as Fed chairman, in part because he has not forgotten where he came from.""A lot of times, you have good theorists in economics but they don't have a feel for the world, they don't have a feel for politics,"" Manning said. ""He has that."""
30,"BRIDGEHAMPTON, New York —Greg Dillon, a psychiatrist, sat in a white rocking chair on the porch of his East Hampton rental home Sunday and diagnosed the panic some of his Wall Street patients are feeling these days.""You lose half of what you've got in the bank and, to them, they've lost half their ego,"" Dillon said. ""The volatility in their mood tracks pretty evenly with the volatility in the market. There is a sense of things falling apart.""As the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped as much as 8 percent from its all-time closing high July 19 over fears of a credit crunch, some psychiatrists were enjoying a bull market for their services. But in the Hamptons, the summer home outside New York City for many Wall Street traders and executives, most people seemed to be taking the financial news in stride.At Bobby Van's Steakhouse in Bridgehampton, where the menu includes $41 broiled lamb chops, every table was filled at 11:30 Friday night.""We could seat the restaurant three times over,"" said the manager, Kristin Regan.On Saturday morning, dozens of people waited in line to buy coffee, pastries and fruit at the Amagansett Farmers Market. Many customers were eating their breakfasts in a garden area furnished with plastic chairs and tables.""You wouldn't know anything is going on on Wall Street,"" said Jeff Huettner, manager of the market. ""People here are driving Bentleys, Ferraris and Porsches like they drive a Chevy anyplace else,"" he said. ""This is Fantasyland.""At Stephen Talkhouse, a music club in Amagansett where Paul McCartney's estranged wife, Heather Mills, was spotted Friday night, at least 30 people were waiting in line to gain entrance at 1 a.m.""The Hamptons are recession-proof,"" said Nick Kraus, a music promoter. ""We're the type of place that would be busier if people lose their jobs. They'll just drink more.""Not everyone is so relaxed. Javier Sumavielle, an emerging-markets trader with Pali Capital, has cut his normal summer four-day weekends in half. He said the demands of the job have reduced his playing time at Buckskill Tennis Club.""I've never seen a crisis like this,"" he said, referring to the subprime mortgage losses, not his tennis game.Jenny Baker, co-owner of Sangha Yoga studio in Montauk, said there had been no slowdown in her business. She said residents worried about Wall Street's problems actually benefited from her service.""Yoga is a good option for them,"" she said. ""They can find some peace.""At a polo match in Bridgehampton, a hedge fund analyst who asked not to be identified said he knew a ""a lot of guys who have gotten crushed"" by the market plunge. ""At the end of the year it will be the haves and have nots,"" he said.Janet Finkel, a Brooklyn Heights resident who owns V2K, a window treatment company, said she was selling her home in East Hampton for $1.7 million. The sale had been supposed to close in October, but Finkel said the buyers wanted to close this week because they were concerned that their financing might fall through if they waited.""Banks have changed the criteria for lending,"" Finkel said while relaxing on the beach in Southampton. ""This is the end of the easy-money boom.""Anthony Ottimo, president of the leasing firm JetOne Jets, said hedge-fund managers were skittish about market volatility.""They're really watching out for their dollars right now,"" he said at Bridgehampton Polo. ""A lot of guys who used to fly and mark it off as personal travel are now paying for their own travel.""Most of the Hamptons residents interviewed over the weekend applauded the decision Friday by the Federal Reserve to cut the interest rate it charged banks. The Dow soared 233 points Friday after dropping 812 points over the previous six sessions.Charles Gargano, former chairman of the Empire State Development Corp., a state agency, said the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, ""deserves a gold medal.""Gargano was standing at a crowded bar at Sag Harbor's landmark American Hotel, built in 1846 at the height of the whaling era. He was surrounded by casually dressed men and women drinking wine and martinis.""The economy is still strong and the fundamentals of the market are still strong,"" he said. ""But people know there might be more pain.""Dillon, the psychiatrist, said the feelings of Wall Street leaders were directly tied to their financial and job status. An executive with a wife and one child may buy a $17 million mansion, not because he needs the space, Dillon said, but because it certifies his place in the business hierarchy.""They are who they are because of their jobs,"" he said."

32,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 20  Democrats in Congress and on the presidential campaign trail are seizing on the turmoil in mortgages to criticize the Bush administration’s laissez-faire approach to what they believe is a spreading crisis.In contrast with the administration’s largely hands-off approach, Democrats are seeking more aggressive, interventionist moves to protect homeowners.Senator Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has summoned Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the chairman of the Federal Reserve to a meeting on Tuesday to discuss steps to stabilize the markets and stave off home foreclosures.Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic front-runner, recently proposed a $1 billion fund to help distressed families catch up on their mortgage payments. In an open letter to President Bush, Mrs. Clinton attacked the president for appearing to minimize the magnitude of problems facing homeowners.John Edwards, the former senator from North Carolina, is proposing a similar bailout fund and has argued that federal regulators should force mortgage lenders to restructure the terms on many of their loans.In Congress, Democratic lawmakers are pushing for changes  and potentially big clashes with the Bush administration  on at least two broad fronts.Many lawmakers want to let Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored lenders that bundle mortgages into tradable securities, to buy and hold more mortgages than they are now allowed.The Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have both pushed in the opposite direction for years, arguing that the two companies had been borrowing money at dangerously high levels by exploiting an implied guarantee of federal support in the event of a financial meltdown.Democrats are also pressing for much tougher regulation of mortgage lenders and brokers. Some have called for stricter rules against what they call deceptive and unfair practices, such as big penalties for paying off a loan early or “teaser” interest rates that start off low but rise sharply after two or three years.Others have proposed rules that would shield homeowners from foreclosure if they declare bankruptcy, or that would allow regulators to force mortgage lenders into rewriting the terms of loans that prove impossible to meet.For the most part, Democrats complain that the administration is being overly passive about the credit crunch.“I am concerned that your public statements may belie the significance of the current challenges,” Mrs. Clinton wrote in her letter to Mr. Bush, dated Friday. “Your statements may signal an unwillingness from the administration to consider even modest and sensible options that could help bring some stability to the housing market.”At a meeting with reporters on Aug. 8, Mr. Bush said the housing market was in the midst of a “necessary reaction” to a flood of cheap money in recent years that had pumped up housing prices to excessive levels.In general, the Bush administration and the Fed have supported a hands-off regulatory policy as banks and mortgage lending companies developed an array of subprime mortgages for people with poor credit and exotic loans that allowed people to borrow without putting any money down, or to qualify for mortgages without documenting their incomes.Although the Fed and other bank regulatory agencies have recently tightened their guidelines for underwriting mortgages, the regulators have been reluctant to restrict what they viewed as potentially important sources of financing that could benefit people with low incomes.Congressional Democrats have been ratcheting up calls for tighter regulation, and even the possibility of bailouts for distressed homeowners.Although Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Edwards have both proposed a fund to help homeowners, the focus in Congress has been on expanding the ability of government-sponsored companies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to finance more home loans.Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York and Senator Dodd have both proposed raising the caps on the volume of mortgages that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can hold in their own portfolios.Both companies package mortgages into securities that can be sold on Wall Street and into world financial markets. But the companies also hold millions of mortgages in their own portfolios. Under current regulations, the companies are each allowed to keep about $700 billion in mortgages, and neither has much room to acquire more loans. Democrats contend that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could provide a crucial source of refinancing for people trying to extricate themselves from unmanageable loans.But the Fed and the Treasury Department have argued that the two companies’ portfolios have effectively become government-sponsored behemoths that crowd out private lenders and could pose big risks to taxpayers if their holdings plunged in value.The Democrats’ broader agenda is to impose tougher regulation on lenders and the giant financial institutions that supply them with capitalRepresentative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the “silver lining” of the implosion in mortgage lending was that it had demolished the reflexive opposition to regulation of almost any kind.“Anyone opposing more regulation can no longer say, ‘if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,’ ” Mr. Frank told reporters last week."
33,"SEOUL, South Korea, Aug. 20  HSBC Holdings said Monday that it was in talks with a Texas-based private equity fund, Lone Star Funds, to buy a majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank, which would give HSBC a long-sought retail banking network in one of Asia’s largest economies.In a short statement posted with the Hong Kong stock exchange, HSBC said that its subsidiary, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, was in talks “about the possible acquisition of a majority stake in Korea Exchange Bank.”Lone Star had no immediate comment, although it had said earlier that it was talking with several potential buyers.HSBC’s announcement of the potential deal  valued at about $4.5 billion  is a vote of confidence in Asian markets and banks, which have been rocked recently by the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States, analysts said.The negotiations suggest that the exposure of South Korean banks to investments linked to risky mortgages in the United States is limited, said Lee Jun-jae, an analyst at Korea Investment and Securities.“Recent market uncertainty over subprime mortgages must have been a concern for HSBC in its talks over Korea Exchange,” Mr. Lee said. “It is noteworthy that it still went ahead and announced its intention. It means HSBC doesn’t see a big problem there.”Lone Star is one of several private equity funds that bought distressed South Korean companies in the aftermath of the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s. Lone Star bought 50.5 percent of Korea Exchange for $1.5 billion in 2003 and later increased its total stake to 64.6 percent, reaping huge gains as the economy recovered. In June, it sold a 13.6 percent stake worth $1.3 billion to buyers including the Hana Financial Group of South Korea. It still holds 51 percent.Lone Star has been trying to cash out its investment, but it has been engaged in protracted legal battles with South Korean prosecutors.Last November, Lone Star canceled a $7.4 billion deal to sell its entire stake to South Korea’s top lender, Kookmin Bank, complaining about an investigation of its operations here by local prosecutors. DBS, a Singapore bank, had held talks with Lone Star about a possible purchase but ended negotiations, hinting at legal issues.South Korean prosecutors brought charges against six people last year, including a former Korea Exchange president, accusing them of manipulating the bank’s financial data to help Lone Star acquire the bank in 2003 at a price that was less than fair.Lone Star denies any involvement. South Korean financial regulators say they will wait for a final court ruling before deciding whether to approve any sale of Korea Exchange.Hong Jin-pyo, an analyst at Good Morning Shinhan Securities, said the local regulators would probably approve Lone Star’s sale of its stake, regardless of the outcome of the court case.“But if the case drags on, it will help HSBC in its negotiations,” Mr. Hong said.Foreign banks have recently sought acquisitions as a means to expand in South Korea. Standard Chartered beat out HSBC to acquire Korea First Bank in 2005.“HSBC wants to expand its presence in Asia,” said Ku Yong-uk, an analyst at Daewoo Securities in Seoul. “But in South Korea it could not get a full banking operation license and was only able to open branch offices mainly for individual customers. This deal, if it goes through, will give HSBC a network to enter full-fledged banking service in South Korea.”"
34,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 21  Senator Christopher J. Dodd, the chairman of the Banking Committee, said today that he had he received assurances that the Federal Reserve was moving to deal with the turmoil spreading from the mortgage market. But he said the response from the Treasury was less encouraging.“I think the Fed gets it” about the seriousness of the problem, Mr. Dodd said after a meeting this morning with the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., to discuss steps to stabilize the markets and stave off home foreclosures. But he added, “I’m still concerned that Treasury doesn’t understand the importance of the issue.”Mr. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is seeking his party’s presidential nomination, said he had asked Mr. Bernanke if the Fed was prepared to use all the tools at its disposal and said the Fed chairman’s response was, “Absolutely.”The senator spoke in a Capitol hearing room after the meeting. Mr. Bernanke and Mr. Paulson did not appear with him.His remarks appeared to lift the stock market, which had opened lower after Mr. Paulson said in an interview that he thought it would take time to work out the problems in the credit markets.Mr. Dodd was careful to make clear that he was not pressing the Fed specifically to lower the federal funds rate, the benchmark rate with the most direct effect on consumers, as it is widely expected to do if its measures so far do not tamp down the upheaval in the credit market.He also said he had raised the possibility of loosening the limits on the holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored lenders that bundle mortgages into tradable securities, a move that many Democrats are pressing for and the White House has resisted.Mr. Dodd said, however, that the Fed and the Treasury “do not appear to be going in that direction.”Among Democrats, Mr. Dodd is considered among the more cautious in his approach to the growing mortgage crisis. He has asserted that changes in the limits on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and new consumer protection rules can be dealt with through the Fed and bank regulatory agencies, rather than through legislation.“The ball is really in their court,” he said, referring to the role of regulators in helping to limit the number of foreclosures.As for providing relief directly to distressed homeowners, as Democrats including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have advocated, Mr. Dodd said, “I’m reluctant to go that way.”Mr. Dodd said he thought Mr. Paulson’s comments this morning in an interview with CNBC had been positive, though he was critical of the Treasury secretary for saying that it would take considerable time to work out the mortgage problems even while affirming that the economy is sound.In his remarks on CNBC, Mr. Paulson said, “We’re thinking through options to reduce the strain in the mortgage markets and clearly focused  and the president wants us to be focused  on actions that can be taken, things that we can do to help mortgage holders who are in danger of losing their homes.”But referring to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, he said, “Raising the cap doesn’t do much of anything,” because the problems are concentrated “in the non-conforming jumbo market and in the subprime market,” not in the markets where those two agencies are active. And he said that loosening the limits on the agencies would require legislative action.He also expressed confidence that with the Fed’s recent actions, including its reduction of its lending rate for banks last week, “I think that as the process unfolds and you see investors gain more confidence, that they understand the risks and the returns here, you’re going to see liquidity return to normal in these markets.”"

36,"BEIJING —China announced Tuesday that it would raise interest rates for a fourth time this year in an effort to contain its racing economy and rein in soaring consumer prices.The People's Bank of China, the central bank, said on its Web site that the benchmark one-year lending rate would rise 18 basis points to 7.02 percent as of Wednesday, and the rate for deposits would rise 27 basis points to 3.6 percent.Analysts said that the rate increase was also aimed at cooling the Chinese stock market which has so far escaped the turmoil that the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis has unleashed on global financial markets.In the aftermath of the U.S. Federal Reserve's move Friday to cut its discount rate to steady financial markets, China's decision demonstrates how the world's fastest growing major economy sometimes appears to be insulated from global economic forces.""China is now counteracting the U.S. cycle,"" said Connie Leung, chief economist at ERA Economic Research Analysis, a research and advisory business in Hong Kong. ""China is one of the few markets in the world to be raising rates rather than holding or cutting rates.""The ruling Communist Party fears that rising prices fueled by an overheated economy could hurt millions of poor Chinese, particularly in rural areas where economic hardship or dissatisfaction with the government can often lead to protests and unrest.But the authorities must avoid too sharp a slowdown because rapid economic growth is needed to provide jobs for millions of surplus rural workers.Leung and other analysts expect China to raise rates further before the end of the year, perhaps more than once, as part of a sustained campaign to bring growth under control.In addition to raising rates, the central bank, six times this year, has ordered lenders to increase the amount of funds they must hold in reserve in an effort to tighten the supply of credit.Many economists had expected China to raise rates further after official statistics showed that inflation jumped to 5.6 percent in July, the biggest monthly increase since 1997, mainly due to steep increases in the cost of food including pork and other household goods.The official target for inflation for 2007 is 3 percent. The Chinese economy expanded at 11.9 percent in the second quarter compared to the same period last year, the fastest growth in more than 12 years as exports and investment continue to boom.In July, China's trade surplus jumped 67 percent from a year earlier to $24 billion. Fixed asset investment in urban China increased 26.6 percent during the first seven months of the year.But, China's top economic planning agency and price watchdog, the National Development and Reform Commission, said the country was not in danger of entering a period of ""full-scale"" inflation, the official China Daily newspaper reported Tuesday.The paper reported that the NDRC had analyzed rising prices and found that they were limited to a narrow ranger of consumer goods.With limited options for investment outside bank deposits, millions of Chinese savers have turned to the stock market in recent years, driving a surge in share prices that has seen the benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rise 80 percent this year following a 130 percent increase last year.The flow of savings to the stock market has accelerated as inflation outpaced interest paid on deposits."

38,"FRANKFURT —European investors sought refuge in government bonds Tuesday, following similar runs in Asia and the United States. But the tone in Europe remained notably different from the deep-seated jumpiness elsewhere, as investors looked past downbeat bits of news to focus on the bigger picture of a growing European economy.Though Europe will eventually have to fear the effects of any slowdown in the United States over the coming year, the group of nations will be largely spared the wrenching effects of unwinding the excesses in mortgage lending that have been wracking Wall Street.Despite the exposure of some European financial institutions to those ""subprime"" investments, Europe will not experience the same kind of meltdown because the lending industry that focuses on borrowers with spotty credit records barely exists in Europe, analysts said. And with the prospect of a softer landing here, investors are better able to size up an economic picture that still looks reasonably sunny.""Now what is dawning on people is that the root cause is in the United States,"" said Kenneth Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. ""The ball has been tossed back over there.""After a Monday session in which the three-month U.S. Treasury bill registered its biggest one-day slide in yield since the 1987 stock market crash, U.S. and European government bonds both rose Tuesday. Yet despite some of that money flowing out of stocks, most benchmark indexes across Europe were up slightly Tuesday at the close.Investors largely shrugged off a collection of new alarm bells - ranging from fresh central bank intervention to negative survey data to worrying comments by a top German banker - which only a week ago might have led to sharp sell-offs.""These are early signs,"" said Jean-Michel Six, chief Europe economist with Standard & Poor's. ""We are starting to see a bit of a decoupling from the atmosphere in the United States.""Yields on three-month U.S. Treasury bills rose Tuesday, but not as much as they fell Monday.The Bank of England, which has so far refrained from intervening in credit markets, announced that it had lent £314 million, or $628 million, to an unspecified bank at its emergency interest rate for the first time since the market turmoil began two weeks ago. The announcement sparked a guessing game as to which bank tapped the cash, though the amount pales in comparison to the multibillion-euro and -dollar injections other central banks have made into money markets.In Germany, the ZEW survey of investor confidence fell in August to its lowest level since last December, largely due to subprime worries.Illustrating the problem, the head of the state-owned German bank WestLB said that investors who normally buy short-term debt from German institutions were shying away from them.""We sense in the markets that the readiness of foreign banks to extend credit lines to German banks has become difficult,"" Alexander Stuhlmann, chief executive of WestLB, said in Berlin, according to news reports.Two weeks ago, German regulators engineered a rescue of IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a small lender in Düsseldorf, and another German bank, SachsenLB, had similar problems revealed on Friday.A WestLB spokesman, Hans Obermeier, said Stuhlmann was emphasizing that a government-sponsored bailout creates ""perception problems"" for German banks, not that there is a general liquidity crisis.The flight of money into U.S. and European government issues was accompanied by signs of increased aversion to bonds sold by other countries that are considered riskier investments.The Philippines and Indonesia, both emerging market economies, scaled back sales at auctions Tuesday because investors demanded returns so high they were deemed too costly.By contrast, demand for bonds from less risky countries grew. New Zealand announced that it would increase the amount of bonds it would offer in an auction this week.

39,"WASHINGTON —Christopher Dodd, the chairman of the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, said Tuesday that he had received assurances that the Federal Reserve was moving to deal with the turmoil spreading from the mortgage market. But he said the response from the Treasury was less encouraging.""I think the Fed gets it,"" Dodd said after a meeting Tuesday morning with the Fed chairman, Ben Bernanke, and the Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., to discuss steps to stabilize the markets and stave off home foreclosures.But he added, ""I'm still concerned that Treasury doesn't understand the importance of the issue.""Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who is seeking his party's presidential nomination, said he had asked Bernanke if the Fed was prepared to use ""all the tools at its disposal"" and said the Fed chairman's response was, ""Absolutely.""Dodd spoke in a Capitol hearing room after the meeting. Bernanke and Paulson did not appear with him.His remarks appeared to lift the stock market, which had opened lower after Paulson said during an interview that he thought it would take time to work out the problems in the credit markets.Dodd was careful to make clear that he was not pressing the Fed specifically to lower the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks. That benchmark rate has the most direct effect on consumers, and the Fed is widely expected to lower it if its measures so far do not tamp down the upheaval in the credit market.He also said he had raised the possibility of loosening the limits on the holdings of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the giant government-sponsored lenders that bundle mortgages into tradable securities, a move that many Democrats are pressing for and that the White House has resisted.Dodd said, however, that the Fed and the Treasury ""do not appear to be going in that direction.""Among Democrats, Dodd is considered among the more cautious in his approach to the growing mortgage crisis. He has asserted that changes in the limits on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and new consumer protection rules can be dealt with through the Fed and bank regulatory agencies, rather than through legislation. ""The ball is really in their court,"" he said, referring to the role of regulators in helping to limit the number of foreclosures.As for providing relief directly to distressed homeowners, as Democrats including Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York have advocated, Dodd said, ""I'm reluctant to go that way.""Dodd said he thought Paulson's comments Tuesday morning during an interview with the cable financial network CNBC had been positive, though he was critical of the Treasury secretary for saying that it would take considerable time to work out the mortgage problems even while affirming that the economy was sound.In his remarks on CNBC, Paulson said, ""We're thinking through options to reduce the strain in the mortgage markets,"" adding that officials were ""clearly focused - and the president wants us to be focused - on actions that can be taken, things that we can do to help mortgage holders who are in danger of losing their homes.""But referring to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, he said, ""Raising the cap doesn't do much of anything,"" because the problems are concentrated ""in the nonconforming jumbo market and in the subprime market,"" not in the markets where those two agencies are active. And he said that loosening the limits on the agencies would require legislative action.He also expressed confidence that with the Fed's recent actions, including its reduction Friday of the rate on its loans to banks, ""I think that as the process unfolds and you see investors gain more confidence, that they understand the risks and the returns here, you're going to see liquidity return to normal in these markets.""The Central Bank of Russia intervened Tuesday to support a weakening ruble and pumped fresh liquidity into the banking system as foreign investors cut their exposure to risky assets in a global credit crunch, Reuters reported from Moscow.Typically, the Central Bank of Russia is seen bidding for dollars as it offsets upward pressure on the ruble stemming from the half a billion petrodollars a day earned by Russia, the world's No. 2 oil exporter after Saudi Arabia.But this time the central bank stepped in as a dollar seller when the ruble eased by over half a percent against the dollar/euro basket of currencies it uses as a target.Analysts said the investor pullback might actually help Russian policy makers in their fight against inflation. The economy minister, German Gref, predicted that consumer price growth would be held within the 8 percent official target this year.The ruble's fall wiped out last week's gains and pared back its advance against the currency basket, composed of 55 U.S. cents and 45 euro cents, to 0.6 percent so far this year."
40,"LONDON —Finance chiefs of the world's two biggest economies pledged Tuesday to keep a close watch on jittery markets, while banks at the sharp end of a global financial storm said they faced serious trouble.The Japanese finance minister, Koji Omi, said there were no plans for an emergency meeting of the Group of Seven industrialized nations because of sharp gyrations in global markets.But Omi said at a press conference that he had spoken by telephone with the U.S. Treasury secretary, Henry Paulson Jr., and that they had agreed to keep a close eye on markets and stay in close contact.""I could tell he has been making various efforts,"" Omi said of Paulson, though he did not give specific details. ""We agreed that we will watch markets developments carefully for a while.""The German finance minister, Peer Steinbrück, insisted that the wider economy was sustaining little damage, an assertion consistently put forward by policy makers so far.""I have no reason to doubt that we can effectively manage the effects of the U.S. mortgage crisis in Europe,"" Steinbrück said, adding that expert opinion suggested that the home loan crisis would not feed through to the real economy.But investors remained ultracautious, fearing there may be more problems that have yet to come to light, stemming from a meltdown in the U.S. subprime sector, which could slow the world economy.""There is still sense of caution in the air,"" said Irvin Seah, an economist at DBS Bank in Singapore. ""If there is more bad news, what we saw last week is probably going to repeat itself. Most people think it will take another two months before things calm down.""U.S. policy makers will hold center stage Tuesday - Paulson, the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben Bernanke, and the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher Dodd, are due to meet to discuss conditions in financial markets.Speculation is feverish that the Federal Reserve may cut the federal funds rate, its key policy rate, from 5.25 percent at its Sept. 18 meeting.On Friday, it cut the discount rate that governs Fed loans to banks by half a percentage point to 5.75 percent, a move that helped bloodied stock markets gain back lost ground.Other central banks remained watchful as doubts about the health of financial markets lingered. Australia's central bank again pumped sizeable amounts of cash into its banking system to help meet short-term mismatches in liquidity.In its regular daily money market operation, the Reserve Bank of Australia added 3.45 billion Australian dollars, or $2.78 billion, in cash. The injection compared with a daily average of about 2.55 billion dollars last week. Before the recent turmoil in markets led to a drying up of credit, the average daily cash injection was around 1.8 billion dollars.The New Zealand Debt Management Office said it would offer an extra 100 million New Zealand dollars, or $70 million, in short-term bonds this week to satisfy a surge in demand amid liquidity concerns.In Berlin, the chief executive of Germany's WestLB bank, Alexander Stuhlmann, said that turmoil in the U.S. subprime mortgage market was making it difficult for German banks to get credit lines from their foreign partners.Stuhlmann told reporters that German banks were in a ""not uncritical situation"" overall.WestLB has said it has over €1.2 billion, or $1.6 billion, in overall exposure to the U.S. subprime sector."
41,"FRANKFURT —European investors sought refuge in government bonds Tuesday, following similar runs in Asia and the United States. But the tone in Europe remained notably different from the deep-seated jumpiness elsewhere, as investors looked past downbeat bits of news to focus on the bigger picture of a growing European economy.Though Europe will eventually have to fear the effects of any economic slowdown in the United States over the coming year, the group of nations will be largely spared the wrenching effects of unwinding the excesses in mortgage lending that have been wracking Wall Street.Despite the exposure of some European financial institutions to those ""subprime"" investments, Europe will not experience the same kind of meltdown because the lending industry that focuses on borrowers with spotty credit records barely exists in Europe, analysts said. And with the prospect of a softer landing here, investors are better able to size up an economic picture that still looks reasonably sunny.""Now what is dawning on people is that the root cause is in the United States,"" said Kenneth Wattret, chief euro-zone economist at BNP Paribas in London. ""The ball has been tossed back over there.""After a Monday during which the benchmark U.S. Treasury bond registered its biggest one-day slide since the 1987 stock market crash, U.S. and European government bonds both gained. Yet despite some of that money flowing out of stocks, most benchmark indexes across Europe were up slightly Tuesday at the close.Investors largely shrugged off a collection of new alarm bells - ranging from fresh central bank intervention to negative survey data to worrying comments by a top German banker - which only a week ago might have led to sharp sell-offs.""These are early signs,"" said Jean-Michel Six, chief Europe economist with Standard & Poor's. ""We are starting to see a bit of a decoupling from the atmosphere in the United States.""Prices for short-term U.S. government debt eased slightly in late afternoon trading Tuesday in New York.The Bank of England, which has so far refrained from intervening in credit markets, announced that it had lent £314 million, or $628 million, to an unspecified bank at its emergency interest rate for the first time since the market turmoil began two weeks ago. The announcement sparked a guessing game as to which bank tapped the cash, though the amount pales in comparison to the multibillion euro and dollar injections other central banks have made into money markets.In Germany, the ZEW survey of investor confidence fell in August to its lowest level since last December, largely due to subprime worries.Illustrating the problem, the head of the state-owned German bank WestLB said that investors who normally buy short-term debt from German institutions are shying away from them.""We sense in the markets that the readiness of foreign banks to extend credit lines to German banks has become difficult,"" Alexander Stuhlmann, chief executive of WestLB, said in Berlin, according to news reports.Two weeks ago, German regulators engineered a rescue of IKB Deutsche Industriebank, a small lender in Düsseldorf, and another German bank, SachsenLB, had similar problems revealed on Friday.A WestLB spokesman, Hans Obermeier, said Stuhlmann was emphasizing that a government-sponsored bailout creates ""perception problems"" for German banks, not that there is a general liquidity crisis.The flight of money into U.S. and European government issues was accompanied by signs of increased aversion to bonds sold by other countries that are considered riskier investments.The Philippines and Indonesia, both emerging market economies, scaled back sales at auctions Tuesday because investors demanded returns so high they were deemed too costly.By contrast, demand for bonds from less risky countries grew. New Zealand announced that it would increase the amount of bonds it would offer in an auction this week. And Greece - a member of the euro zone - managed to sell €1.44 billion, or $1.95 billion, in 15-year bonds, more than originally planned.To be sure, the potential for a bombshell to send European markets reeling is all too present.U.S. mortgage lenders packaged subprime mortgages into securities that were sold globally to investors hungry for a higher returns - and willing to take the risks.

43,"WASHINGTON, Aug. 21 — Wall Street thinks the Federal Reserve is running short of time.After another day of restless anxiety in the world’s credit markets, most lenders and investors remained fearful of all but the very safest Treasury securities, and new figures showed that the rate of foreclosures in the housing market in July was almost double that of a year ago.Analysts now say that the central bank’s move last Friday to restore confidence by encouraging banks to borrow directly from the Fed at a lower cost has had only limited impact so far and that the Fed will need to take more drastic action by cutting its benchmark interest rate soon if it fails to see more progress.“I would calibrate it in days, not weeks,” said Richard Berner, chief United States economist at Morgan Stanley. “If the money markets are still in disarray a few days from now, I would think the Fed is going to have to take additional steps.”But the central bank’s chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, and most other Fed policy makers are extremely reluctant to have the Fed jump to the rescue with an interest rate cut simply to relieve the woes of investors on Wall Street or to bail out hedge funds and others that many blame for the current problems caused by excessive investment in risky mortgages. Instead, the Fed is much more closely watching for clues to whether the housing market itself and consumer spending are weakening before deciding that it needs to cut interest rates.That means an imminent reduction in the Fed’s key policy tool, the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks, is still far from a sure bet.The big issue facing the Fed — whether or not to cut the federal funds rate by a quarter point or even half a point from its current level of 5.25 percent and when to do so if it decides a cut is warranted — poses major risks for Mr. Bernanke. Since taking over the Fed in February 2006, Mr. Bernanke’s hallmark has been a cool patience and willingness to stick with his economic game plan even when it clashed with the expectations on Wall Street.But Mr. Bernanke does not have the luxury of time. Lessons from the last big credit crunch, which came after Russia’s financial meltdown in August 1998, show that timid action has little effect, while a quick and decisive follow-up move can make a major difference.On the other hand, any sign that the central bank has itself become overly nervous about the situation by moving precipitously could compound the anxiety that has paralyzed investors about everything from mortgages to commercial bonds.The Federal Reserve rarely changes its benchmark interest rate between its official policy meetings, and only when it faces an unexpected shock. The last time it did so was a week after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The Fed’s next meeting is not scheduled to occur until Sept. 18.But the Fed is under time pressure in part because it pointedly raised expectations of a broader rate cut last Friday when it declared that it was “prepared to act as needed” to help the economy weather disruptions in the markets.The Fed’s first move — to entice banks into borrowing through its so-called “discount window” — has done almost nothing to jumpstart lending, many analysts now say.“It’s not clear that the discount window was a viable option,” said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor who is now vice chairman at Macroeconomic Advisers. “It just doesn’t seem like it is going to be a very effective tool in adding liquidity.”Fed officials and top Treasury officials continued on Tuesday to talk by telephone with major banks, encouraging them to borrow from the discount window and repeating that there was no stigma associated with such loans. Traditionally, banks have only resorted to the Fed’s discount window when they had no other place to borrow money.In a separate move, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cut in half the fee it charges banks to borrow Treasury securities. Fed officials described the move as “purely technical,” though it dovetailed with investors’ rush to find safety in Treasury bills.Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut and chairman of the banking committee, met with Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on Tuesday morning. He said the Fed chairman told him that he would use “all available tools” to head off a surge in mortgage foreclosures.If Wall Street regains even a small part of its past willingness to finance mortgages and commercial loans, Fed policy makers could gain enough breathing room to postpone a decision until their next scheduled policy meeting.Fed officials would probably prefer to wait until their Sept. 18 meeting, by which time they will have more information on whether the fear in financial markets has in fact translated to problems in the real economy.Indeed, there were signs Tuesday of an internal debate about the need to cut rates at all.Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said in a speech to risk managers in North Carolina on Tuesday that turmoil in financial markets was not a reason in itself to reduce rates.“Interest rate policy needs to be guided by the outlook for real spending and inflation,” Mr. Lacker said, adding that many of the market’s problems are simply a reaction to previous “misjudgments” about the exotic mortgages.There were hints on Tuesday that such fears, stemming in large part from the meltdown in mortgage markets, were ebbing slightly. The stock market was relatively tranquil for the second day on Tuesday and while investors continued to cling to short-term Treasury bills, a sign of risk aversion, rates moved up later in the day, suggesting that some of those anxieties were easing. And prices of credit swaps tied to Countrywide Financial, the giant but struggling mortgage lender, declined slightly.But Fed officials had little cause for cheer. Banc of America Securities downgraded the stocks of two major homebuilders — Toll Brothers and Hovnanian Enterprises — because of the growing number of customers canceling contracts for new homes.And RealtyTrac, a publisher of databases on foreclosures, said on Tuesday that the number of foreclosure filings jumped 9 percent in July, to 179,599, and was 93 percent higher than in July 2006.More than half of those threatened foreclosures were in California, Florida, Michigan, Ohio and Georgia, RealtyTrac reported. But 43 states experienced an increase in such filings compared with one year ago.Though many big pending leverage buyouts have run into problems with financing, Fed officials have long been skeptical about the economic impact of such difficulties.The real issue for policy makers is whether companies are investing less in new equipment and construction, or whether consumer spending is being seriously undermined.To that end, Mr. Bernanke appears to be paying especially close attention to the health of the housing market. Fed officials have recently acknowledged that the downturn in housing over the last 18 months has been deeper and more protracted than they expected, and the Fed was clearly startled by the recent panic associated with subprime mortgages and other exotic home loans.Until two weeks ago, Fed officials had steadfastly contended that they saw little spillover from woes in the housing market to the broader economy. And while they had acknowledged acute problems among people with weak credit who took out subprime loans, officials contended that subprime mortgages were a small part of all home loans.But Fed officials now concede that problems in the mortgage market are broader than they once thought, with problems surfacing in so-called “Alt-A” mortgages, from interest-only loans to “no-doc” loans in which borrowers do not need to document their incomes. Fears about the hidden risks in mortgages have now prompted many investors to back away even from conventional mortgages.Fed officials were pleasantly surprised earlier this year that the plunge in home building, which began more than a year ago, has not led to higher unemployment or lower consumer spending. But they repeatedly cautioned that uncertainties about housing still posed the biggest risk to their forecast for a “soft landing.”"
44,"LONDON, Aug. 22 —Clouds persisted Wednesday over European credit markets, with some commercial banks still reluctant to lend to each other.The European Central Bank said it lent 1.84 billion euros, or $2.5 billion, on Wednesday to institutions that need cash outside of its weekly auctions — the largest amount of emergency loans in more than two months.In another move, the E.C.B. also said it would inject 40 billion euros in three-month lending into the banking system to provide more liquidity to cash-starved markets.The E.C.B. typically injects money into the system to help banks operate smoothly in two ways: via one-week lending conducted each week and lending for three months, done on the last Wednesday of each month.In the past two weeks, it has added a number of overnight injections, but this is the first time since it was founded in 1998 that it has offered up additional three-month money.Separately, Barclays, the British bank, was forced to turn to the Bank of England for a £314 million, or $625 million, loan after missing a deadline to get a loan from HSBC Holdings. “Banks are very much at the epicenter of what is going on in the financial markets right now,” said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management in London. Still, investment banks or banks with a large investment banking business, may need to be less worried about liquidity but more about revenue, analysts said.The current credit crunch has already started to affect mergers and acquisitions, stalling some takeovers because volatile markets mean executives are unsure whether they are paying the right price. Fees from hedge funds, leveraged lending and share and bond sales may also drop, hurting the third-quarter bottom line.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a London-based research firm specializing in financial services companies, said Deutsche Bank is the one most at risk among European investment banks because of its large trading business that must now contend with volatile markets. Banks with a low exposure to capital markets, generally those in Greece and the Nordic regions, may be more resilient to the credit crunch.Yet not all investors make such fine distinctions and bad news from one easily transfers to others. Continued uncertainty over whether European banks themselves can fully assess their exposure to the U.S. subprime crisis or its fallout further weighs on investor confidence.“There are a lot of moving parts and targets floating around so that all the risks we see currently are weighted on the downside,” said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.Fears about exposure to subprime-related investments also has triggered unusual dislocations in credit markets, where banks typically borrow from one another or, in a pinch, the central bank to meet daily financing needs, and avoid keeping idle cash on their books. Financial institutions issue interest-bearing “commercial paper,” at maturities like three months, to investors like money market funds to meet short-term funding needs.The E.C.B.’s cash contributions have helped calm overnight lending, but key three-month European rates have remained stubbornly elevated, in part because regular investors in short-term debt remain skittish. They are refusing to accept securities that might have a link to the subprime sector as collateral for lending. That forces borrowers to offer higher rates to attract investors.“This money is aimed at addressing the funding issue until confidence returns and the system unclogs,” said Rob Carnell, a senior economist at ING in London. “Anything that has the whiff of the subprime sector is hard to use for lending these days.”The E.C.B. also said its statement that plans for interest rates were outlined by Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank president who earlier in the month hinted at a possible increase in its benchmark rate on Sept. 6, but stressed the bank never promises such a step in advance. The statement Wednesday led markets to bid up the potential for a rate increase next month, economists said.While most analysts and investors still struggle to value the damage caused by the American subprime crises to European banks and to find possible future victims as visibility of exposure remains low, they said that the threat of more nasty surprises was greater in some countries and among certain sectors in the banking industry than others.Banks in countries like Germany, where banks faced tougher competition in their home market and margins are lower compared to their European peers, may have been more willing to pile on riskier investments, such as subprime loans. In July, IKB Deutsche Industriebank spooked investors when the German bank unexpectedly disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group, providing 3.5 billion euros to cover potential losses.In contrast, banks in Greece and Spain may be better situated to escape relatively unscathed because they profited from strong growth at home and had less of an incentive to invest in riskier assets abroad. Italian banks have also been focusing on the domestic market and on improving efficiency rather than expanding abroad. They also profited from strong mortgage growth at home over the last five years. Smaller and regional banks pulled out of United States markets following the dot-com bubble and have not returned.Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy said last week that he believes the country faces no particular risk from the credit crunch because Italian banks have been more cautious on real estate lending than others.Nevertheless, smaller and regional banks can be more at risk because they do not have the same ability to absorb potential losses or liquidity squeezes than larger institutions, analysts said.“For the large universal banks in Europe, the financial fall-out of the subprime crisis is manageable,” said Antonio Carballo, managing director at Moody’s Investors Service. “If current market conditions persist or worsen, the ultimate credit implications could be significant for a select number of smaller and less diversified banks.”"
45,"Wall Street ended another erratic session with mixed results yesterday as investors, waiting for the Federal Reserve’s next move to steady the markets, made few big commitments to stocks.Comments from policy makers and government officials tugged at a market looking for any evidence the Fed would cut rates to help contain the credit crisis that began with failures in subprime loans.The Fed has taken a number of steps to prop up financial institutions ahead of its scheduled Sept. 18 meeting, including injecting more liquidity into the banking industry and cutting the discount rate. But many on Wall Street want the Fed to do more, including lowering the more important federal funds rate, and to do it before next month’s meeting.Traders reacted positively to comments from the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Christopher J. Dodd, who said the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was not satisfied with Wall Street’s response to his efforts to stabilize markets torn by anxiety about shrinking credit.Senator Dodd, after meeting with Mr. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., said policy makers planned to use “all tools available.”But the bullishness cooled after Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, said the central bank’s policy must be guided by fundamentals, rather than market swings  indicating that a cut in the fed funds rate might not be among the tools the Fed plans to use.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 30.49 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,090.86.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 1.57 points, or 0.1 percent, to 1,447.12, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 12.71 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,521.30. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies added 0.93 point, or 0.1 percent, to 788.38.Bonds continued to rally as investors moved money from stocks to the safer haven of the Treasury market. But the yield on the three-month Treasury bill rose to 3.60 percent, erasing some of the last few days’ declines, as some investors stepped away from the ultra-safe assets.The 10-year Treasury note was up 8/32, to 101 8/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 4.59 percent from 4.63 percent.The day’s trading session echoed the erratic pattern of Monday. But yesterday’s volatility was much more mild as investors took a more cautious tone.“The lack of volatility usually means markets are complacent and vulnerable,” said A. C. Moore, chief investment strategist for Dunvegan Associates. “Volatility isn’t a bad thing, and usually is positive after an initial down swing like we had. It means cash reserves are being raised and employed.”Trading also reflected speculation that the global credit squeeze is nowhere near over. Countrywide Financial was said to be a takeover target because of losses linked to distressed subprime mortgages. And investors expected more layoffs after Capital One Financial said it was closing its GreenPoint Mortgage unit and cutting 1,900 jobs. Capital One rose $1.75, to $68.47; Countrywide spiked $1.98, to $21.79.Following are the results of yesterday’s auction of four-week Treasury bills."
46,"Harry Macklowe, the New York developer, was flying high in February when he decided to buy a portfolio of prime Midtown Manhattan office towers for nearly $7 billion, using only $50 million of his own money.Mr. Macklowe was already well represented in the Midtown market, where rents were rising at a staggering rate. His 2003 purchase of the General Motors Building on 59th Street and Fifth Avenue for $1.4 billion, though derided at the time as reckless, had been vindicated as the value of the building soared, enhancing Mr. Macklowe’s reputation as a visionary tycoon.But as the crisis over subprime residential mortgages spills over into other real estate sectors, causing a severe tightening of credit, there is widespread talk in the industry that Mr. Macklowe is in deep trouble — so much so that he could lose control not only of the newly acquired portfolio but also of the G.M. Building and other properties that were used as collateral for short-term debt that must be repaid six months from now.Through a spokesman, Mr. Macklowe, who lost the Hotel Macklowe in a real estate squeeze in the mid-’90s, declined a request for comment. But his son, William S. Macklowe, expressed confidence that their company, Macklowe Properties, would be able to pay off the debt.Some real estate specialists say that the February acquisition of the seven Manhattan buildings — a deal consummated in just 10 business days —will be remembered not just as a feat of financial derring-do but also as a watershed that ended two years of frenzy in the commercial real estate market.“If you’re looking for a poster child for what’s been going on, it could well be that deal,” said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., that specializes in real estate investment funds. “It had all the elements of the froth in the market — assets flipping left and right at ever-higher prices and excessive amounts of debt at ultracheap prices.”Recently, many sales have been postponed, canceled or restructured, according to investment brokers and lawyers. As with residential mortgages, commercial loans are pooled and packaged into bonds that are sliced into portions carrying different degrees of risk. In recent weeks, investors have largely shunned these securities backed by commercial mortgages.Highly leveraged loans “are not being made or are very rare now,” said Robert O. Bach, a senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis, a national brokerage company. “So, some people would say, there’s been more of a return to sanity.”As the credit markets tighten, capital is expected to become more expensive, causing building values to drop. So far, however, there is no evidence that sales prices have declined, and brokers say there is still plenty of money available for real estate investments from foreigners attracted by the cheap dollar as well as from cash-rich pension funds and insurance companies.In a deal completed this month, Prudential Real Estate Investors paid $280 million in cash for the Democracy Center in Bethesda, Md., according to the seller’s broker, William M. Collins, a managing director at Cassidy & Pinkard Colliers, a brokerage firm in the Washington area.But in other signs of how the credit squeeze is affecting sales transactions, Tishman Speyer and Lehman Brothers recently postponed the completion of their $22 billion acquisition of Archstone-Smith, a real estate investment trust that owns interests in nearly 88,000 apartments, from late this month until early October. (Shareholders approved the sale yesterday.)And a REIT that specializes in office buildings in Silicon Valley, Mission West Properties of Cupertino, Calif., said last week that its planned $1.8 billion acquisition by a private equity company had fallen through because the buyer’s lender had withdrawn from the transaction and no substitute lender could be found.To be sure, the leasing market in many cities has been strong, nowhere more so than in Midtown, where landlords are now asking an average annual rent of more than $81 a square foot, a record, according to the brokerage firm CB Richard Ellis. Few large blocks of space are available. The default rate for commercial buildings has remained low.But for several months, bond ratings analysts and others have warned that competition among commercial lenders has become so feverish that many are willing to finance 90 percent or more of the cost of the transaction based on overly optimistic projections that rents will continue to rise at a furious pace. In recent transactions, including Mr. Macklowe’s, the expected initial income from the buildings was less than 4 percent a year, with cash flow projected to rise significantly as leases expired and rents reached market levels.But in the recent hot market, said Adrian Zuckerman, a real estate lawyer at Epstein Becker & Green, “people were not buying the income stream; they were buying the building for what they could sell it for in a year or two years.”Scott A. Singer, the executive vice president of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, a real estate finance and brokerage company, said long-established investors “have often found themselves on the sidelines while other players without a strong track record have bid up deals, using a lot of leverage.”Among the relative unknowns who gained prominence in this market was Scott J. Lawlor, the chief executive of Broadway Partners of New York, which made its first real estate investment in 2000 by buying a former school building in Hartsdale, N.Y., for $4.8 million. Since then, Broadway has bought more than $15 billion worth of office towers, including the John Hancock Building in Boston, keeping most of them a few years or less and then reselling them for a handsome profit.The Blackstone Group, the private equity company that recently went public, played on an even bigger scale. It bought Equity Office Properties, the nation’s largest office landlord, for $39 billion in February, and simultaneously began to dismantle it.Without even taking possession of the buildings, Blackstone sold most of Equity Office’s portfolio in Manhattan to Mr. Macklowe in the transaction that is now raising questions. (The portfolio originally included the office portion of an eighth building, but that was later dropped from the deal.)The problem for Mr. Macklowe is that much of the debt — $3.4 billion, according to Commercial Mortgage Alert, a weekly trade publication — is in the form of a short-term investment known as a bridge loan or preferred equity that must be repaid in February. Of that amount, about $900 million came from the hedge fund Fortress Investment Group, with the rest supplied by Deutsche Bank, Mr. Macklowe’s longtime lender. Mr. Macklowe pledged the G.M. Building and other assets as collateral.But with credit now far less available, Mr. Macklowe is expected to have a harder time refinancing to repay the short-term debt. And typically, said Mr. Zuckerman, who was not involved in the Macklowe transaction, when the rent does not cover the debt service, the difference is added to the loan principal.In an interview in his sleek corner office at the G.M. Building overlooking Central Park, the younger Mr. Macklowe, who is known as Billy, shrugged off the concerns and said the company had always planned to take on new partners. He said it was in “advanced discussions” with three groups that could replace the bridge loan with permanent capital.“That’s how we always looked at the deal,” he said. The company’s next steps may also include “one or two divestitures” of some of its buildings, he said.He said the tightening of the credit market is likely to discourage “the speculative construction that’s planned — which means that the market would only get tighter.” And in such a market, he said, high-quality buildings like the ones owned by the Macklowes would have the most appeal to investors. “In brief moments of uncertainty,” he said, “one tends to find a flight to quality in terms of investing.”Indeed, few real estate specialists are counting the Macklowes out just yet. A lot can happen in six months, several people said.“He always manages to land on his feet,” said Howard L. Michaels, the chief executive of the Carlton Group, a company that has helped arrange financing for some of Mr. Macklowe’s deals. “Everybody’s watching to see what he does.”"
47,"LONDON —Stocks rallied worldwide Wednesday on hopes of an interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, but clouds persisted over credit markets, with some commercial banks still reluctant to lend to each other.The European Central Bank said it had lent €1.84 billion, or $2.5 billion, Wednesday to institutions that needed cash outside of its weekly auctions - the largest amount of emergency loans in more than two months. In another dramatic move, the ECB also said it would inject €40 billion in three-month lending into the banking system to provide more liquidity to cash-starved markets.Across the Atlantic, the four largest U.S. banks announced that they had each borrowed $500 million from the Fed's discount window on behalf of clients, after the Fed cut the interest rate it charges to help direct more cash to companies last week.The transactions were ""intended to display the effectiveness"" of the discount window, JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wachovia said in a joint statement. The fourth bank, Citigroup, said separately that it was ""pleased to inject liquidity into the financial system during times of market stress and to support credit-worthy clients,"" Bloomberg News reported.The ECB typically injects money into the system to help banks operate smoothly in two ways: via one-week lending conducted each week and lending for three months, done on the last Wednesday of each month.In the past two weeks, it has added a number of overnight injections, but this is the first time since it was founded in 1998 that it has offered additional three-month money.Separately, Barclays, the British bank, was forced to turn to the Bank of England for a £314 million, or $625 million, loan after missing a deadline to get a loan from HSBC Holdings.""Banks are very much at the epicenter of what is going on in the financial markets right now,"" said James Bevan, chief investment officer at CCLA Investment Management in London.Still, investment banks or banks with a large investment banking business, may need to be less worried about liquidity but more about revenue, analysts said. The current credit crunch has already started to affect mergers and acquisitions, stalling some takeovers because volatile markets mean executives are unsure whether they are paying the right price. Fees from hedge funds, leveraged lending and share and bond sales may also drop, hurting the third-quarter bottom line.Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, a London-based research firm specializing in financial services companies, said Deutsche Bank is the one most at risk among European investment banks because of its large trading business that must now contend with volatile markets. Banks with a low exposure to capital markets, generally those in Greece and the Nordic regions, may be more resilient to the credit crunch.Yet not all investors make such fine distinctions and bad news from one easily transfers to others. Continued uncertainty over whether European banks themselves can fully assess their exposure to the U.S. subprime crisis or its fallout further weighs on investor confidence.""There are a lot of moving parts and targets floating around so that all the risks we see currently are weighted on the downside,"" said Sandy Chen, an analyst at Panmure Gordon in London.Fears about exposure to subprime-related investments also has triggered unusual dislocations in credit markets, where banks typically borrow from one another or, in a pinch, the central bank to meet daily financing needs, and avoid keeping idle cash on their books.Financial institutions issue interest-bearing ""commercial paper,"" at maturities like three months, to investors like money market funds to meet short-term funding needs.The ECB's cash contributions have helped calm overnight lending, but key three-month European rates have remained stubbornly elevated, in part because regular investors in short-term debt remain skittish. They are refusing to accept securities that might have a link to the subprime sector as collateral for lending. That forces borrowers to offer higher rates to attract investors.""This money is aimed at addressing the funding issue until confidence returns and the system unclogs,"" said Rob Carnell, a senior economist at ING in London. ""Anything that has the whiff of the subprime sector is hard to use for lending these days.""The ECB also said its statement that plans for interest rates were outlined by Jean-Claude Trichet, the bank president who earlier in the month hinted at a possible increase in its benchmark rate on Sept. 6, but stressed the bank never promises such a step in advance.The statement Wednesday led markets to bid up the potential for a rate increase next month, economists said.While most analysts and investors still struggle to value the damage caused by the U.S. subprime crises to European banks and to find possible future victims as visibility of exposure remains low, they said that the threat of more nasty surprises was greater in some countries and among certain sectors in the banking industry than others.Banks in countries like Germany, where banks faced tougher competition in their home market and margins are lower compared to their European peers, may have been more willing to pile on riskier investments, such as subprime loans.In July, IKB Deutsche Industriebank spooked investors when the German bank unexpectedly disclosed deteriorating subprime investments and had to be bailed out by a government-backed group, providing €3.5 billion to cover potential losses.In contrast, banks in Greece and Spain may be better situated to escape relatively unscathed because they profited from strong growth at home and had less of an incentive to invest in riskier assets abroad.Italian banks have also been focusing on the domestic market and on improving efficiency rather than expanding abroad.They also profited from strong mortgage growth at home over the last five years. Smaller and regional banks pulled out of U.S. markets following the dot-com bubble and have not returned.Prime Minister Romano Prodi of Italy said last week that he believes the country faces no particular risk from the credit crunch because Italian banks have been more cautious on real estate lending than others.Nevertheless, smaller and regional banks can be more at risk because they do not have the same ability to absorb potential losses or liquidity squeezes than larger institutions, analysts said.""For the large universal banks in Europe, the financial fall-out of the subprime crisis is manageable,"" said Antonio Carballo, managing director at Moody's Investors Service. ""If current market conditions persist or worsen, the ultimate credit implications could be significant for a select number of smaller and less diversified banks."""
48,"NEW YORK —The New York developer Harry Macklowe was flying high in February when he decided with breathtaking speed to buy a portfolio of prime Midtown Manhattan office towers for nearly $7 billion, using only $50 million of his own money.Macklowe was already well represented in the Midtown market, where rents were rising at a staggering rate. His 2003 purchase of the General Motors Building on 59th Street and Fifth Avenue for $1.4 billion, though derided at the time as reckless, had been vindicated as the value of the building soared, enhancing Macklowe's reputation as a visionary tycoon.But as the crisis over subprime residential mortgages spills over into other real estate sectors, causing a severe tightening of credit, there is widespread speculation in the industry that Macklowe is in deep trouble - so much so that he could lose control not only of the newly acquired portfolio but also of the GM Building and other properties that were used as collateral for short-term debt that must be repaid six months from now.Through a spokesman, Macklowe, who lost the Hotel Macklowe in a real estate squeeze in the mid-1990s, declined a request for comment.But his son, William Macklowe, expressed confidence that their company, Macklowe Properties, would be able to pay off the debt.Some real estate specialists say the February acquisition of the seven Manhattan buildings - a deal consummated in just 10 business days -would be remembered not just as a feat of financial derring-do but also as a watershed that ended two years of frenzy in the commercial real estate market.""If you're looking for a poster child for what's been going on, it could well be that deal,"" said Mike Kirby, a principal of Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, California, that specializes in real estate investment funds. ""It had all the elements of the froth in the market - assets flipping left and right at ever-higher prices and excessive amounts of debt at ultracheap prices.""In the last few weeks, many sales have been postponed, canceled or restructured, according to investment brokers and lawyers. As with residential mortgages, commercial loans are pooled and packaged into bonds that are sliced into portions carrying different degrees of risk. In recent weeks, investors have largely shunned these securities backed by commercial mortgages.Highly leveraged loans ""are not being made or are very rare now,"" said Robert Bach, a senior vice president at Grubb & Ellis, a national brokerage company based in Chicago. ""So, some people would say, there's been more of a return to sanity.""As the credit markets tighten, capital is expected to become more expensive, causing building values to drop. So far, however, there is no evidence that sales prices have declined, and brokers say there is still plenty of capital available for real estate investments from foreigners attracted by the cheap dollar as well as from cash-rich pension funds and insurance companies.Scott Singer, executive vice president of Singer & Bassuk Organization, a real estate finance and brokerage company, said long-established investors ""have often found themselves on the sidelines while other players without a strong track record have bid up deals, using a lot of leverage.""Among the relative unknowns who gained prominence in this market was Scott Lawlor, chief executive of Broadway Partners of New York, which made its first real estate investment in 2000 by buying a former school building in Hartsdale, New York, for $4.8 million.

49,"HONG KONG —Private equity firms are setting records in the size of Asian buyout funds, adding to an existing pool of more than $35 billion that is waiting to be deployed in deals in the region, industry participants and analysts said.The aggressive fund-raising drive in pan-Asian and country-specific buyout funds is occurring at a time of tightening credit markets, volatility in equity markets and some resistance from shareholders and regulators to private equity buyouts.Analysts said this mix of conditions posed new challenges for private equity firms in replicating the deals on which they built their reputations for strong returns to investors.But led by several global buyout funds, investors are expected to commit $25 billion more in the second half of this year to private equity funds in Asia, according to the Center for Asia Private Equity Research. That would be on top of $15.4 billion in fresh capital committed to regional funds in the first half of 2007, a rise of 57 percent over the period a year earlier.In recent months, big private equity firms have been leapfrogging each other to set records for fund size. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts this year built a $4 billion Asia fund; TPG, formerly Texas Pacific Group, is expected to close in the coming weeks on an Asia fund of about $4.2 billion; and CVC Capital Partners has built one that could reach $5 billion.Even at such sizes, the Asian funds are still well below levels set by buyout funds in more mature markets like Europe, where KKR, for example, is seeking to raise a fund of at least €7.7 billion, or $10.4 billion.""There is so much international capital looking to find a home in private equity generally, and Asia is regarded as particularly attractive at the moment,"" said Andy Thomson, editor of Private Equity International in London.Asian markets, on the back of strong economic growth, have performed better in recent years, and big investors are increasingly interested in diversifying from traditional regions like Europe and North America.But other analysts said the growth of this Asian private equity war chest coincided with increasing difficulties for the industry in completing big-ticket deals, even before the subprime mortgage crisis in the United States put a squeeze on credit markets and brought volatility in share markets.The Center for Asia Private Equity Research has tracked a marked increase in the number and dollar size of deal failures since the start of the year. It identified 22 deal failures valued at $38.9 billion from January to the end of July because of regulatory hurdles or because shareholders of target companies had rejected the price on offer.Australia, which has been one of the leading markets in the region for private equity deals in the past two years, has also led the way in high-profile failures, including the collapse of the proposed buyout of Qantas Airways.In several deals in Australia, private equity buyers were either outbid by strategic investors or shareholders were unwilling to accept the valuations. Elsewhere in the region, regulatory hurdles are often the bigger problem for the industry.Kathleen Ng, managing director of the center, said private equity firms in Asia would have to seek more deals in the hundreds of millions, rather than billions, of dollars and be satisfied with minority positions in companies instead of buyouts as they managed those difficulties.In the meantime, there is a lot more money chasing deals in the region. Ng estimated that the current overhang of unallocated funds in Asia stood at $35.7 billion at the end of July, with the amount set to grow sharply.""It's a testing time,"" she said. ""But private equity investors are very innovative. They find a way to devise a deal.""Although the recent market problems have added to the complications, Ng said there was intense demand from investors in private equity funds, like pension funds and insurance companies, that have long-term investment horizons.Market volatility may also foster more deals. If the recent market problems start to affect the broad economy, analysts and industry participants said, there could be a return to some of the bargain-hunting that private equity benefited from in the early part of the decade.""Periods of volatility are normal in Asia,"" said Dan Carroll, a senior partner with TPG in Hong Kong. ""And it is in times of volatility that we have done our better deals.""He said TPG's deal pipeline remained ""very active,"" and he expressed confidence that the firm would be to able fully allocate its latest fund-raising.A lot of that deal action is likely to be in China, while Australia could slip, which would be a significant turnaround.According to figures released by Thomson Financial last month, Australia topped the region, excluding Japan, for private equity deals in the first half of the year, with $12.3 billion in deal value. China ranked sixth, with deals worth $678.7 million completed.""Australia had an outsized year in 2006, going into 2007 well above the historical mean, and that is correcting a bit,"" Carroll said. ""China and Japan will be increasingly active markets in the next couple of years."""
